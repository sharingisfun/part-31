To many developmental math students, algebra is like a foreign language. They have difficulty translating the words, their meanings, and how they apply to problem solving. Emphasizing the &quot;language of algebra,&quot; the text's fully integrated learning process is designed to expand students' reasoning abilities and teach them how to read, write, and think mathematically. It blends instructional approaches that include vocabulary, practice, and well-defined pedagogy with an emphasis on reasoning, modeling, communication, and technology skills.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 1072 pages\n    * Publisher: Brooks Cole; 4 edition (April 12, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1439044317\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1439044315","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa1d34f82e7e4fdf2671d074327789a5fcc6ec4","amp;dn":"Prealgebra+4th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa1d34f82e7e4fdf2671d074327789a5fcc6ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,161,211,79,130,231,228,253,242,103,29,7,67,39,120,154,95,204,110,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
