I'm the little sister.  If you'd have asked me, I would prefer to be the older sister.  I'll never know what it feels like to have a little sister who does everything exactly like me.  Who tries to open the lock on my diary, listening at my door when I talk about boys with my best friends, stealing my clothes from behind my back, and cutting out pictures from my favorite magazines.  In fact, I would have liked to be my own sister, just for the chance to have me as my sister!\n\nThe Sisters is a series of comics which tells the story of two sisters, Wendy and Marine.
