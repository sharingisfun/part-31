They also suggest that Boris Johnson may be the illegitimate step nephew of Louis XV and how all your financial opinions come from a warped fortune cookie written by some guy that just dropped massive tabs of acid. And they discuss this while minding their Second Amendment right to bear a shoulder launch missile. In the second half, Max interviews Birgitta Jonsdottir about the need to form Pirate Parties around the world to protect privacy, democracy and stop financial blockades of certain groups for their beliefs and campaigns.\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
