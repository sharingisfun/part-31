The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Failed StatesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ debuts today and can be heard now by going HERE. Fans can pre-order Failed States now at The Epitaph Store. Additionally, Propagandhi will kick off a North American tour in September with support from Comback Kid. Dates are listed below.\n\nFailed States willfully careens between brazen metallic tendencies and the ragged punk rock roots of Propagandhi's earlier work, further raising the lyrical and musical bar set by their critically-acclaimed 2009 release, Supporting Cast(e).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Our goal is always to create a no-holds-barred, forward-thinking, tip-of-the-hat to the giants -- Voivod, Rush, NoMeansNo, SNFU, Sacrifice, Razor, Guilt Parade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that have gone before us,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says vocalist and guitarist, Jesus H. Chris. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are in their debt and take the mission seriously. Even when we're singing about liking Kurt Russell as Captain Ron, we take the mission seriously. Failed States is our most formidable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to me personally, our most surprising -- attempt at conjuring the numinous from the quotidian. Yes, I had to look those words up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe result is one of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most forward thinking and musically varied albums to date. Failed States is not simply proof of Propagandhi's continued dedication to pushing their musical boundaries, but an evocative (and provocative) meditation on human nature, meaning and life under an expanding, planet-wide technocracy. Ranging from dynamic, progressive rock of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Note To SelfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the accelerated heaviness of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duplicate Keys Icaro (An Interim Report)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and blazing thrash cuts like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hadron CollisionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Things I Like,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Propagandhi has created a truly monumental sixth album.\n\nStay tuned to www.propagandhi.com and www.epitaph.com to hear new music from Failed States and for news about Propagandhi!\n\n01.
