The series focuses on the new X-Factor team and their many issues, along with crossing over with the other X-Men titles for several major storylines (including Decimation and Messiah CompleX). Well worth the read if you are a fan of previous incarnations of the team, or love Peter David's work. \n\nThis series actually carries on from the Madrox: Multiple Choice miniseries, which you can find here, thanks to STFMaryville: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7960476&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7960476&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent contains digital copies of all 50 issues, as well as the two specials that feature in this run - Layla Miller and The Quick And The Dead. Every copy is courtesy of Son of Ultron-Empire in high-res, except for Layla Miller which is by Cypher-Empire (also in HQ). Thanks to the scanner groups for their awesome efforts; these issues look great. Please seed and enjoy. \n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it:       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b36ca3012785ad26799e69454c687fb6fe7bce","amp;dn":"X-Factor+v3+01-50+%2B+Ex+%282006-2009%7CDigital%7CSon+Of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b36ca3012785ad26799e69454c687fb6fe7bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,179,108,163,1,39,133,173,38,121,158,105,69,76,104,127,182,254,123,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
