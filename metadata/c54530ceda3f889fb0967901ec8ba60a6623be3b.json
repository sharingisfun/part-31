With          \n       yet another Grammy-nominated soundtrack, there's              \n       plenty of music here, but also quite an entertaining          \n       story.                                                        \n                                                                     \n         Note that the DVD edition was marginally cut                \n       following John Denver's 1997 death in a plane crash.          \n       Originally there was a plane sequence with him and            \n       Rowlf the Dog, which was cut for sensitivity reasons.         \n       Some have questioned this decision however, since like        \n       JFK Jr. who would die in another plane crash two years        \n       later, he was in fact very fond of flying. To honor           \n       this we have included the clip from an old VHS as an          \n       extra, so you can enjoy it in its entirety. The first         \n       few seconds are from the DVD, to more easily put it           \n       into context.                                                 \n                       Enjoy!                                        \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                                \n                                                                      \n                              ~HO HO HO~                              \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                 For the month of December we've decided to      \n                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent       \n                 calendar will be celebrating the life and          \n                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings       \n               until his untimely death 20 years ago.             \n                                                               \n           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing     \n         you new titles from the archives, including     \n        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips     \n      and behind the scenes footage, from every     \n          type of source available to us. Our goal        \n        is to provide real insight into the vast       \n     output of one of the greatest story-          \n     tellers of the 20th century, and the         \n           many talented performers and enablers       \n      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.      \n                                                 \n                    Sit back and join us as we go looking      \n                  for the rainbow connection, and remember    \n               to check back daily.
