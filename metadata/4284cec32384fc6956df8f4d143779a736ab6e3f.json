I know I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the happily ever after. My knight in shining armor took the highway detour around this god forsaken shit hole. I've made peace with that. That doesn't mean IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to lay down like a doormat and let every cocky prick in the trailer park have his way with me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nCass lives a depressing life in a small trailer park in Eddington, Georgia, with her mother and abusive boyfriend Jackson. She works hard to barely make ends meet. But everything changes when Tucker White, the lead singer in the band Damaged, walks into her diner. He tries to show her that there is more to life than the hand she has been dealt, but Cass soon learns that being with Tucker will come at a high price.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4284cec32384fc6956df8f4d143779a736ab6e3f","amp;dn":"Teresa+Mummert+-+White+Trash+Beautiful","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4284cec32384fc6956df8f4d143779a736ab6e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,132,206,195,35,132,252,105,86,223,143,77,20,55,121,167,54,171,110,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
