In a culture that bombards us with feel-good-about-yourself spirituality, Seeking Peace may not dispense popular wisdom, yet it is sure to satisfy a deep hunger. There is a peace greater than self-fulfillment, a peace greater than nations no longer at war. But it will demand a relentless pursuit kept up only by hope and courage, vision and commitment.\n\nSeeking Peace explores many facets of humankind's ageless search for peace. It plumbs a wealth of spiritual traditions and draws on the wisdom of some exceptional (and some very ordinary) people who have found peace in surprising places.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.plough.com/en/ebooks/s/seeking-peace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.plough.com/en/ebooks/s/seeking-peace&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ea4276e23f7bff3f1cf0744c2f911fbbd51443","amp;dn":"Seeking+peace%2C+By+Johann+Christoph+Arnold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ea4276e23f7bff3f1cf0744c2f911fbbd51443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,234,66,118,226,63,123,255,63,28,240,116,76,47,145,31,187,213,20,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
