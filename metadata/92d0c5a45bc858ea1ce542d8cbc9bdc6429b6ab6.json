The title track kicks off the album with soul-wrenching melodies and pulls us in from the first few bars. 'Windmill' brings a fresh melody and cool synths mixed with some soft strings. 'Take My Guitar', 'Give You My Love' featuring Adrina Thorpe, 'Acapulco' and 'Oriente' each bring a different flavour, stretching the boundaries of what trance music can be.\n\nAn added benefit, Yerevan's release is further bolstered by the addition of two of SoundLift's classics. 'Horizonte' and 'Nakhti' are presented on this album along with the full plate of fantastic new work!\n\nRelease date: 30th September 2011.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1)   SoundLift - Yerevan (3:32)\n2)   SoundLift feat. Adrina Thorpe - Give You My Love (9:25)\n3)   SoundLift - Take My Guitar (7:01)\n4)   SoundLift - Windmill (8:49)\n5)   SoundLift - Horizonte (9:09)\n6)   SoundLift - Nakhti (9:44)\n7)   SoundLift - Land Of Nowhere (9:20)\n8)   SoundLift - Oriente (7:58)\n9)   SoundLift - One Day (10:14)\n10)  SoundLift - Acapulco (4:00)\n\n100% virus free.\n\nThese are only 128kbps as I reduce all my albums to this bit rate so that I fit more music onto my iPhone.\n\nHope you enjoy and please leave comments, thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d0c5a45bc858ea1ce542d8cbc9bdc6429b6ab6","amp;dn":"SOUNDLIFT+-+YEREVAN+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d0c5a45bc858ea1ce542d8cbc9bdc6429b6ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,208,197,164,91,200,88,234,28,229,66,216,203,201,189,198,66,155,106,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
