This version became an MTV staple and helped to establish the band in the mainstream. Marilyn Manson added some extra lines to the lyrics that are not present in the Eurythmics version: &quot;I wanna use you and abuse you/I wanna know what's inside you,&quot; along with &quot;I'm gonna use you and abuse you/I'm gonna know what's inside you.&quot; The video for Manson's cover contains several clips of Manson and bandmates in what appears to be an abandoned building. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: this was one of the first videos shot with a director, not based solely on what the band came up with. In between the clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving droppings on his body, and of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat and covered with mud. In 2010 the music video was rated the &quot;Scariest music video ever made&quot; by Billboard, beating Michael Jacksons Thriller for the top spot  \n\n         ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce1e80ddee043857bd8365b6354b3abd0301845","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+413","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce1e80ddee043857bd8365b6354b3abd0301845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,225,232,13,222,224,67,133,123,216,54,91,99,84,179,171,208,48,24,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
