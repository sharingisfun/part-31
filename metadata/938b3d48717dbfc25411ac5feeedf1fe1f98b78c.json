Although each programmer brings different goals and\nexperiences to the table, most developers end up solving similar tasks in their development work:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do I build a table?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do I create a secure keychain entry?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do I search the Address Book?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do I move between views?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do I use Core Location?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe iPhone DeveloperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cookbook is aimed squarely at anyone just getting started with iPhone programming.With its clear, fully documented examples, it will get you up to speed and working productively.
