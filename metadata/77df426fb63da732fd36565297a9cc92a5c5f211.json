But whoever this nameless woman was, and whatever befell her, is knowledge lost to another time. . . . \n\nBoston, 1830: In order to pay for his education, Norris Marshall, a talented but penniless student at Boston Medical College, has joined the ranks of local &quot;resurrectionists&quot;--those who plunder graveyards and harvest the dead for sale on the black market. Yet even this ghoulish commerce pales beside the shocking murder of a nurse found mutilated on the university hospital grounds. And when a distinguished doctor meets the same grisly fate, Norris finds that trafficking in the illicit cadaver trade has made him a prime suspect.\n\nTo prove his innocence, Norris must track down the only witness to have glimpsed the killer: Rose Connolly, a beautiful seamstress from the Boston slums who fears she may be the next victim. Joined by a sardonic, keenly intelligent young man named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Norris and Rose comb the cityÃ¢â‚¬â€œfrom its grim cemeteries and autopsy suites to its glittering mansions and centers of Brahmin powerÃ¢â‚¬â€œon the trail of a maniacal fiend who lurks where least expected . . . and who waits for his next lethal opportunity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77df426fb63da732fd36565297a9cc92a5c5f211","amp;dn":"The+Bone+Garden+-+Tess+Gerritsen+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77df426fb63da732fd36565297a9cc92a5c5f211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,223,66,111,182,61,167,50,253,54,86,82,151,169,204,146,165,197,242,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
