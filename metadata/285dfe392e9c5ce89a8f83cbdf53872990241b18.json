It was distributed by MGM and Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2012.[2] It features Daniel Craig in his third performance as James Bond, and Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the film's antagonist. The film was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan.\n\nThe film centres on Bond investigating an attack on MI6; the attack is part of a plot by former MI6 operative Raoul Silva to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. The film sees the return of two recurring characters to the series after an absence of two films: Q, played by Ben Whishaw, and Eve Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris. Skyfall is the last film of the series for Judi Dench, who played M, a role that she had played in the previous six films. The position is subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character, Gareth Mallory.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVideo        :  MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x544 23.976fps 1600kbps\n\nAudio        :  AC-3 6-channel 48KHz 448kbps\n\nGenre        :  Action/Adventure/Crime \n \nRuntime      :  143 mins\n\nIMBD Rating  :  7.8\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285dfe392e9c5ce89a8f83cbdf53872990241b18","amp;dn":"Skyfall+%282012%29+%5B+BRRip+%2F+x264+%2F+AC3+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285dfe392e9c5ce89a8f83cbdf53872990241b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,93,254,57,46,156,92,232,154,143,131,203,223,83,135,41,144,36,27,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
