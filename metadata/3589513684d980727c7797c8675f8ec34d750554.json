Meanwhile, King Rolen plans his jubilee unaware of the growing threat to those he loves.\n\nBy royal decree, all those afflicted with Affinity must serve the Abbey or face death. Sent to the Abbey because of his innate Affinity, the KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s youngest son, Fyn, trains to become a warrior monk. Unfortunately, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a gentle dreamer and the other acolytes bully him. The only way he can escape them is to serve the Abbey Mystic, but his Affinity is weak.\n\nFiercely loyal, thirteen year-old Piro is horrified to discover she is also cursed with unwanted Affinity. It broke their motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart to send Fyn away, so she hides her affliction. But, when Fyn confesses his troubles, Piro risks exposure to help him.\n\nEven though Byren Kingson is only seven minutes younger than his twin, Lence, who is the king's heir, Byren has never hungered for the Rolencian throne. When a Seer predicts that he will kill Lence, he laughs. But Lence Kingsheir sees ByrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growing popularity and resents it. Enduring loyalty could be ByrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest failing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3589513684d980727c7797c8675f8ec34d750554","amp;dn":"Rowena+Cory+Daniels+-+%5BChronicles+of+King+Rolen%5C%27s+Kin+01%5D+-+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3589513684d980727c7797c8675f8ec34d750554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,137,81,54,132,217,128,114,124,119,151,200,103,95,142,195,77,117,5,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
