Otherwake definitely deepens our Chris Harvey fandom, and we love how throughout the entire album it sounds like there are zillions of synthy little bubbles softly popping all around you. All the more so on good speakers.&quot;\n-- Magnatune.com\n\n====================\n\nGreat ambient music that really stimulates your focus and creativity. Be sure to follow the artist info link and purchase this music if you like it, half of all purchases go directly to the artist!\n\nI'll leave the conversion to other formats to you, just spreading some great music.\n\nEnjoy,\n~ Prideless","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bd6f5eb6a4e61264041005b1e1d6add92f8e2b","amp;dn":"%5BPrideless%5D+Chris+Harvey+-+Discography+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bd6f5eb6a4e61264041005b1e1d6add92f8e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,189,111,94,182,164,230,18,100,4,16,5,177,225,214,173,217,47,142,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
