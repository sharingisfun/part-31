As the various systems on board an aircraft evolve to become more and more inter-dependent and integrated, it is becoming increasingly important for designers to have a holistic view and knowledge of aircraft systems in order to produce an effective design for their individual components and effectively combine the systems involved.\n\n\nThis book introduces the military roles expected of aircraft types and describes the avionics systems required to fulfil these roles. These range from technology and architectures through to navigations systems, sensors, computing architectures and the human-machine interface. It enables students to put together combinations of systems in order to perform specific military roles.\n* Sister volume to the authors\\' previous successful title \\'Civil Avionics Systems\\'\n* Covers a wide range of military aircraft roles and systems applications\n* Offers clear and concise system descriptions\n* Includes case studies and examples from current projects\n* Features full colour illustrations detailing aircraft display systems\n\nMilitary Avionics Systems will appeal to practitioners in the aerospace industry across many disciplines such as aerospace engineers, designers, pilots, aircrew, maintenance engineers, ground crew, navigation experts, weapons developers and instrumentation developers. It also provides a valuable reference source to students in the fields of systems and aerospace engineering and avionics.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 542 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (May 10, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470016329\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470016329","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98b6d1ba3ab80970807b7a5bd589a884f1c7d3f","amp;dn":"Military+Avionics+Systems%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98b6d1ba3ab80970807b7a5bd589a884f1c7d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,139,109,27,163,171,128,151,8,7,183,165,189,88,154,136,79,28,125,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
