The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1991, prior to the recording of the band's second album, Kerplunk, and has been a member of the band ever since.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned it a grassroots fanbase.[1] In 1994, its major label debut Dookie became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S.[2] As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.[3][4] Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively.[5] Their 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.[5] The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009.\n\nGreen Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide and 24.639 million in the US alone.[6] They have won four Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, and Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical has been nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design, and has received generally positive reviews.\n\nSee full history at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThe most Comprehensive Green Day discog ANYWHERE!, All in 320*, fully tagged, 500x500 album art.\n\nAll Studio Albums\n1.  1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours (2007 Remaster)\n2.

So to my research, singles not included do not have any content not already else where in this Discog.\n\n***Note 3: What is the difference you might ask, The EP Pre-Release includes &quot;Highway 1&quot; Not on the full release. EP is also only 6 songs.\n\n****Note 4: This album isn't Green Day Exactly, but they do appear in some songs, and 1 Bonus song is Green Day. Also I included in the comments of the ID3 the individual performers' names if the whole cast isn't in that song, so when it says Cast, that means everyone.\n\nENJOY, please help me Seed, let this Green Day torrent over take all others, so all can enjoy all thier content in crisp 320 :)\n\nHMD3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54747eb561b1094f8495a88aa4db4f5f0941afa6","amp;dn":"Green+Day+Comprehensive+Discog+%5B320kbps%5D+%2B+The+Network%2C+Foxboro+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54747eb561b1094f8495a88aa4db4f5f0941afa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,116,126,181,97,177,9,79,132,149,168,138,164,219,79,95,9,65,175,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
