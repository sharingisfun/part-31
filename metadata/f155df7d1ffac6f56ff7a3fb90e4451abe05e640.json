The music for Blue Velvet Revisited is every bit as noirishly evocative as the billing would suggest. Fusing elements of contemporary classical (â€˜Lumbertonâ€™) to jazz (â€˜So Fucking Suaveâ€™) to ambient electronica (â€˜Do It for Van Goghâ€™) to krautrock (â€˜Jeffrey Nothingâ€™), but never fully surrendering to any, Tuxedomoon and Cult with No Name have produced a suite that is as unique as it is representative of both artists. In addition, the album sees a contribution from John Foxx, the eerie ambience of â€˜Lincoln Streetâ€™ providing a perfect axis around which Tuxedomoon and Cult with No Name can weave their magic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f155df7d1ffac6f56ff7a3fb90e4451abe05e640","amp;dn":"Tuxedomoon+%26amp%3B+Cult+with+No+Name-Blue+Velvet+Revisited+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f155df7d1ffac6f56ff7a3fb90e4451abe05e640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,85,223,125,31,250,198,245,111,247,163,251,144,228,69,26,190,5,230,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
