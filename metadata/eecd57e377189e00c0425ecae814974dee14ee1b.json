During this time he gave many and varied teachings, a few of which have already been published in Becoming Your Own Therapist, Make Your Mind an Ocean and The Peaceful Stillness of the Silent Mind.\n\nThis book contains the teachings and meditations Lama gave at a five-day retreat he led near Melbourne, Australia, which he introduced by saying:\n\n&quot;Whether or not this five-day meditation course becomes beneficial is up to you; it depends on your own mind. It?s not a lama thing; I?m not going to bring you to enlightenment in this short time. Instead of having too many expectations of the lama, it?s better that you generate a pure motivation for being here. Expectations cause mental problems; instead of being positive, they become negative...\n\n&quot;If over the next five days you can begin to recognize the reality of your own nature, this meditation course will have been worthwhile. Therefore, dedicate your actions during this time to discovering inner freedom through recognizing the negative characteristics of your own uncontrolled mind.&quot;\n\nIn line with Lama?s intentions, this book is dedicated to the awakening of inner freedom within the minds of its readers and all other sentient beings.\n\n(Uploaded through the kind permission of)          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.lamayeshe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.lamayeshe.com&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************************************************************************\n*                                                                                 *\n*  *LYWA      *LYWA*      *LYWA* *LYWA   *LYWA   *LYWA    *LYWA   *LYWA*          *\n*   LYWA        LYWA      LYWA    LYWA    LYWA    LYWA     LYWA    *LYWA*         *\n*   LYWA         LYWA    LYWA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA     LYWA    *L.Y.WA*        *\n*   LYWA          LYWA  LYWA       LYWA     LYWA LYWA     LYWA    LYWALYWA        *\n*   LYWA           LYWALYWA         LYWA    LYWALYWA     LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA            L.Y.WA          LYWA     L.Y.WA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWA    LYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWALYWALYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA   L.Y.W.A   LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA  LYWA LYWA *LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              LYWALYWA   LYWALYWA    LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              L.Y.W.A    L.Y.W.A     LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA               LYWA*      LYWA*     LYWA          LYWA   *\n*  ~LYWA*LYWA*LYWA* ~LYWA~              LYWA       LYWA     ~LYWA~        ~LYWA~  *\n*                                                                                 *\n*      ~LAMA~      *      ~YESHE~       *      ~WISDOM~      *      ~ARCHIVE~     *\n*                                                                                 *\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.\n\nPlease visit http://www.lamayeshe.com for HEAPS of Dharma material\n\nLama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.
