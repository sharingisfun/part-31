The first section describes general features of common human viruses with specialized chapters related to HIV/AIDS. The volume goes on to describe exotic virus infections, including one now eradicated virus (smallpox) and some now controlled by vaccination such as yellow fever. Concepts of medical virology are further developed with entries on viruses associated with oncogenesis and selections of interest to medical virology.\n\nThe most comprehensive single-volume source providing an overview of virology issues related to human and medical applications\nBridges the gap between basic undergraduate texts and specialized reviews\nConcise and general overviews of important topics within the field will help in preparation of lectures, writing reports, or drafting grant applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18bcfd957793816bb80fb3467fdc649be0a4ed81","amp;dn":"Desk+Encyclopedia+of+Human+And+Medical+Virology+%28Iradins%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18bcfd957793816bb80fb3467fdc649be0a4ed81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,188,253,149,119,147,129,107,184,15,179,70,127,220,100,155,224,164,237,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
