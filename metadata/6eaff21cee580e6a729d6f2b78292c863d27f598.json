Re-emerging in the 1990s, it's still only been\nrecentlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the release of the overdue reissue of his 1974 ECM classic, The\nJewel in the Lotus in 2007, and his first album as a leader in eight years, the\nsublime Penumbra (Cryptogramophone, 2006)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that the woodwind\nmulti-instrumentalist has returned to greater visibility. Early Reflections's\ninstrumentation may be a more conventional setting than Penumbra's\nwoodwinds/bass/drums/percussion line-up, but it's just as fine, its generally\nsubdued tone broken by occasional bursts of fiery intensity.\n\nLike Polish trumpeter Tomasz StankoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who nurtured a young Polish piano trio that\nhas supported him since Soul of Things (ECM, 2000) but has also built its own\nindependent reputation with Trio (ECM, 2005)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Maupin has &quot;discovered&quot; an equally\nfine trio of Polish musicians in pianist Michael Tokaj, bassist Michal Baranski\nand drummer Kukasz Zyta.\n\nLike Stanko's find, Maupin's group demonstrates elegant simplicity on the\nballadic &quot;Inner Sky&quot; and delicately propulsive &quot;Atma.&quot; The latter is one of two\nto feature Hania Chowaniec-RybkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a singer who, despite this being her first\nimprovisational album away from classical and Tatras folk roots, melds\nbeautifully with Maupin's soprano sax, and with his alto flute on the dark-hued\ncloser, &quot;Spirits of the Tatras.&quot; Her improvisational prowess during the extended\nfree opening to &quot;Spirits of the Tatras&quot; transcends conventional scatting with\nthe same kind of timbral explorations as innovators including Meredith Monk and\nSidsel Endresen. But while its intro is more vibrant in tone, it ultimately\nmorphs into a brooding ballad feature for the impressionistic Tokaj.\n\nSolo space abounds on the softly Latin-esque &quot;Escondido,&quot; a feature for Maupin's\nsignature bass clarinet; the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Tears,&quot; with Maupin again on\nalto flute; the in-and-out-of-time ballad &quot;Inner Sky&quot;; and a more rhythmically\ndefined waltz-time retake of The Jewel in the Lotus' title track that, beginning\nin simmering subtlety, turns into a burning modal workout for Tokaj and Maupin's\nmost powerful solos of the set.\n\nBreaking up the extended tracks are four miniature collective improvisations\nthat bear a surprising sense of construction. The opening &quot;In Reach,&quot; in\nparticular, demonstrates the kind of deep interaction normally only heard from\ngroups with considerably more than the two years this group has under its belt.\n\nRecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in artists who first made their\nname in decades past. It's only been in the past decade that Tomasz Stanko and\nEnrico Rava have achieved the international visibility they've always deserved,\nand Maupin can now be added to that list, thanks to Cryptogramophone. Penumbra\nand the equally outstanding Early Reflections book-end The Jewel in the LotusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a\npromise Maupin never managed to follow upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½demonstrating two very different sides\nand making it clear that he's truly back and better than ever.\n\nTrack listing:\n01 - Within Reach\n02 - Escondido\n03 - Inside the Shadows\n04 - ATMA\n05 - Ours Again\n06 - The Jewel in the Lotus\n07 - Black Ice\n08 - Tears\n09 - Not Later Than Now\n10 - Early Reflections\n11 - Inner Sky\n12 - Prophet's Motifs\n13 - Spirits of the Tatras.\n\nPersonnel:\n* Bennie Maupin: bass clarinet, tenor and soprano saxophones, alto flute\n* Michal Tokaj: piano\n* Michal Baranski: bass\n* Lukasz Zyta: drums, percussion\n* Hania Chowaniec-Rybka: voice (4, 13).\n\nPublished: April 18, 2008\nStyle: Modern Jazz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eaff21cee580e6a729d6f2b78292c863d27f598","amp;dn":"The+Bennie+Maupin+Quartet+-+Early+Reflections+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eaff21cee580e6a729d6f2b78292c863d27f598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,175,242,28,238,88,14,106,114,157,111,43,120,41,44,134,61,39,245,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
