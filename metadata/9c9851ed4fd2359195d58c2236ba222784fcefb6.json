By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released over twenty albums and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia,[1] they served as an inspiration for later similar groups.\nDuring the early 1990s Mortification played death metal, thrash, and grindcore, and &quot;belonged to the elite of the death metal movement,&quot; especially with their 1992 album Scrolls of the Megilloth. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with Blood World in 1994 and received critically acclaim for 1996's EnVision EvAngelene.[1] Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, &quot;the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene&quot;,[2] and have been described as &quot;a legend in the death metal scene.&quot;[3] In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukaemia and took 18 months to recover. Mortification issued their tenth album, Triumph of Mercy in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, Brain Cleaner.In 1987, bass guitarist and vocalist Steve Rowe formed the Australian power metal band LightForce with Murray Adams on guitar, Steve Johnson on vocals and Errol Willenberg on drums.[4] The group played on the local metal scene and signed with United States label, Pure Metal Records to release their debut album, Mystical Thieves in May 1989.[4] They supported US Christian glam metallers, Stryper on their 1989 tour of Australia. In 1990, Rowe, was determined to play heavy music with a Christian message, and was joined by drummer Jayson Sherlock and guitarist Cameron Hall under the LightForce name to record the demo, Break the Curse. The group had changed musically towards thrash metal with a death metal influence and when Michael Carlisle replaced Hall on guitar, they were renamed as Mortification. According to Rowe, the name comes from the King James Bible, &quot;Mortify therefore the deeds of the flesh.&quot;[5] Break the Curse was released in 1991 as Mortification's second album.[4]\nIn early 1991, they released their self-titled debut album on the US Christian label Intense Records.[4] The direction of the music had changed once again. A lot of the songs were taken from their demo Break the Curse, but the band tuned their guitars down, and the feel to the songs was a lot more heavy and doomy than on previous material. Also, Rowe proved to be an excellent death metal vocalist, presenting his &quot;Grind Baritone vocals of extreme reality&quot; throughout the album. According to Allmusic, the band &quot;sought to provide a positive alternative to traditional death metal acts such as Carcass, Death, and Obituary. On the strength of their self-titled 1990 debut, Mortification quickly gained a reputation in their native Australia for being one of the loudest and fastest bands around.&quot;[6]\nIn 1992, the band signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records in Germany,[4] which had many European death metal groups on their roster. Mortification released their third album, Scrolls of the Megilloth, which had great success and, in the Christian metal scene, is considered a classic as well as a piece of Australian metal history. The line-up had outdone themselves, playing some fast death metal with a few doom metal influences on a couple of tracks. According to Allmusic, the album contains &quot;some of the most frightening vocals ever recorded.&quot;[6] A video-compilation titled Grind Planets which featured eight Mortification music-videos shot by film maker Neil Johnson was also released. Grind Planets, the title is a word play of the term 'Rock Star'.[7] It presented a more humorous side of Mortification on the &quot;On the Road&quot; material in contrast with their serious message about spiritual warfare - a common theme among Christian extreme metal bands during early 1990s when anti-Christian bands such as Deicide and Morbid Angel gained popularity.\nThe band conquered new ground with their 1993 release Post Momentary Affliction. Most notably, the vocal style shifted, adding some thrash-like screams to the already-familiar metal growls. The band also experimented with the industrial style. The album also featured one of Mortification's most popular songs,[citation needed] &quot;Grind Planetarium&quot;. Jayson Sherlock had his last concert with the band at the Blackstump Festival '93, and the concert was released both on CD and also VHS under the name Live Planetarium. A big US major magazine cited the Live Planetarium video as the best live album and video they have ever seen and heard.[8] Jayson joined ParamÃƒÂ¦cium, and Phil Gibson replaced him as Mortification's drummer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9851ed4fd2359195d58c2236ba222784fcefb6","amp;dn":"Mortification+-+Discography++%281991+-+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9851ed4fd2359195d58c2236ba222784fcefb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,152,81,237,79,210,53,145,149,213,140,34,54,186,34,39,132,252,239,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
