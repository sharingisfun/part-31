Davidson\nHardcover: 260 pages\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan (March 15, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0230614825\nISBN-13: 978-0230614826\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nRelease date: March 15, 2011 | ISBN-10: 0230614825 | ISBN-13: 978-0230614826\nWhy do Britain, France, and Italy provide or refuse military support for U.S.-led uses of force? This book provides a unique, multiple-case study analysis of transatlantic burden-sharing. Sixty original interviews with top policymakers and analysts provide insight into allies' decisions regarding the Kosovo War (1999), Afghanistan (2001), and the Iraq War (2003). The cases show that neoclassical realist factors--alliance value, threat, prestige, and electoral politics--explain allies' decisions better than constructivist factors--identity and norms. The book briefly covers additional cases (Vietnam, Lebanon, the Persian Gulf War, Somalia) and concludes with recommendations for increasing future allied military support.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Jason W. Davidson's exceptional book is a must read for scholars and policy makers interested in knowing why states put troops in harm's way for the benefit of their allies. Davidson's masterful explanation of burden sharing is essential knowledge for students of history and politics, as well as decision makers crafting strategy for the future.&quot; - Patricia A. Weitsman, Professor of Political Science, Ohio University\n\n&quot;Much has been made about America's departure from its multilateralist past in recent years, but few have asked the question of why U.S. allies contribute to American military actions. Who are the willing in the 'coalitions of the willing?' And what do they gain from such contributions? Jason W. Davidson offers the most comprehensive account of this aspect of alliance politics so far, constructing a novel argument that blends elements of both international power and domestic needs. This is an important book for students and supporters of the transatlantic partnership.&quot; - Brian Rathbun, Assistant Professor of International Relations, University of Southern California\n\n&quot;Davidson's in-depth study, based on a large number of interviews with officials and opinion-makers, displays a profound understanding of the complex domestic forces and perceptions shaping foreign policy options. The analysis thus integrates first hand research materials and theoretical tools in assessing foreign policy.A careful screening of empirical results and the author's genuine curiosity of foreign political cultures makes for a rare combination.&quot; - Roberto Menotti, Senior Research Fellow, Aspen Institute Italia\n\n'Focusing on Britain, France, and Italy in seven case studies, Davidson notes that they contributed a fair amount in Lebanon, the Persian Gulf War, Somalia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. They refrained, to be sure, in the case of Vietnam, and only Britain contributed in the Second Gulf War. Davidson uses three variables to explain this. If the 'alliance value' is high, if 'prestige' or 'threat' to national interest is high, and if public opinion is supportive or irrelevant, allies will contribute to US-led efforts.' - Choice\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJason W.
