Posing as a sympathizer and activist on behalf of the Nazi cause, Carlson gained access to the inner sanctum of the traitors - great and small - who sought to replace the Stars and Stripes with the Swastika. In Under Cover, the author chronicles the operations and ideological tenets of a large (and frequently overlapping) group of organizations that operated on behalf of the Third Reich (and also Imperial Japan). As Carlson illustrates in the book, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmall fryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ domestic fascists are often catsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ paws for larger, more prominent political and economic figures. Many of the organizations were actually directed and financed by the Deutsches Ausland InstitutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the foreign section of the Nazi party of Germany. Among the most virulent of the above-ground Fifth Column groups was the German-American Bund, composed largely of U.S. citizens of Germanic extraction. Like many domestic fascist movements the Bund represented itself as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpatriotic.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dismissed by some as unimportant, the Bund and other, similar organizations were anything but trivial. Carlson notes the importance of the Bund, as well as the networking that domestic fascist groups did with important personages, including members of Congress. One can not stress too heavily that these subversives and traitors represented themselves as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpatriots.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Carlson notes the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpatrioticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ makeover that the Bund underwent. Note that much Third Reich propaganda and many spies came to the U.S. on the Hamburg-Amerika Line, one of the companies that featured the Bush family in partnership with the Third Reich. If patriotism isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as Dr. Johnson observedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe last refuge of a scoundrel,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ then religion is usually the first. A staggering number of the fascist Fifth Column organizations in the U.S. professed to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChristian.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Most prominent among the fascists marching behind the faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of Christianity was the infamous Father Coughlin -- the driving force behind the Christian Front. Railing against President Roosevelt, Jews and anything that stood in the way of the Third ReichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s path of conquest, Couglin used Social Justice as his primary bully pulpit. After the war, it emerged that he was actually in the pay of Third Reich intelligence. Invoking the name of Jesus to support everything Christ condemned, fascists and fascist institutions masquerading as Christians abounded within the Fifth ColumnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Reverend Gerald Winrod, the Christian Mobilizers, The Cross and the Flag, ad infinitum. Indeed, the author was able to infiltrate the Fifth Column by posing as a fascist pamphleteer, publishing The Christian Defender whith ingratiated him to the traitors. When evaluating the significance of the Fifth Column for contemporary Americans, it is important to remember that there was no de-Nazification process for the United States after the war. The Nazi conspirators in this country not only went untouched, many of them became prominent, or continued in positions of prominence. In addition, some of the most heinous Third Reich alumni were imported into this country under the auspices of the Gehlen spy organization, Project Paperclip and the Crusade For Freedom, where they joined their domestic American partners in corrupting postwar American politics. When written, this amazing book turned into an instant bestseller but is today virtually unknown among Americans and Germans alike. Find out how the skillfuly made Nazi propaganda machine (greatly financed from America itself) turned blind patriotic Americans into the most fervent supporters of Hitler and how the same tactics is used today to ignite false patriotism and nationalism in order to establish a fascist totalitarian regime in USA. 520 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9c166c0de33ac7192b6f60e57384a98d0e6406","amp;dn":"Carlson-Under+Cover-My+Four+Years+in+Nazi+Underworld+in+USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9c166c0de33ac7192b6f60e57384a98d0e6406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,156,22,108,13,227,58,199,25,43,111,96,229,115,132,169,141,14,100,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
