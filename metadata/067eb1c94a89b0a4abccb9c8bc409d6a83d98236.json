Their dreams of making enough money to settle down happily in one place are shattered when a traffic accident kills his mother, and his father takes so badly to drink that Shane becomes the de facto head of the household. When his grandfather dies, leaving Shane a small ranch in his will, he hopes that his dream might come true at last. But how can a 14-year-old boy turn the run-down place around and keep the banker from seizing it, while attending school and looking after a father who is usually in the liability column?\n\nThis Film is very rare and hard to find PLEASE keep seeding!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067eb1c94a89b0a4abccb9c8bc409d6a83d98236","amp;dn":"Cowboys+Dont+Cry+1988+DVD-R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067eb1c94a89b0a4abccb9c8bc409d6a83d98236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,126,177,201,74,137,176,164,171,204,185,200,188,64,157,106,131,217,130,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
