The country studies illuminate four comparative themes in a global context: the world of states, examining the interaction of states within the international order; governing the economy, covering the role of the state in economic management; the democratic idea, discussing the pressure for more democracy and the challenges of democratization; and the politics of collective identities, studying the political impact of diverse attachments and sources of group identity.\n\nThe theoretical framework developed in an expanded introduction provides a rich context for each country study, and clear prose makes the book accessible to students with little or no background in political science. Students will also benefit from the data sheet at the beginning of each chapter that includes basic demographic, socioeconomic, and political information, to aid in country comparisons. In addition, they can use the Geographic Setting sections in each chapter, as well as maps, tables, charts, photographs, and political cartoons to further their understanding of each country studied.\n\n    * New! Updated content includes coverage of recent events such as the May 2005 general election in Britain and the referendum in France.\n    * New! Civil liberties, security, political conflict, political identities and military policy are considered in the context of a post-September 11 world.\n    * All 12 country studies, as well as five additional studies, are available in an online database. Instructors may choose from among these chapters (a minimum of 7) to create a customized text. Recent additions to the database include studies of East-Central Europe, South Africa, Indonesia, Turkey, and Cuba.\n    * Key terms appear as bold in the text and a glossary at the end defines key concepts in comparative politics. In addition, an appendix explains the Human Development Index.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0f6c0b314d5c1ceae8ee92babbc8bf0aad3bd1","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Comparative+Politics%3A+Mexico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0f6c0b314d5c1ceae8ee92babbc8bf0aad3bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,15,108,11,49,77,92,28,234,232,238,146,186,187,200,191,10,173,59,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
