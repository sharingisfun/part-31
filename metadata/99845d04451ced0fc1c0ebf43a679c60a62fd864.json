Just in time to warm up your ears during the cold winter days and nights. His sense of balance between sonic energies is exquisite: never too dry and heavy but always serious enough to keep you traveling inwards, never too light and obvious but always subtle enough to keep you flying. This is mature space music for interstellar excursions into unknown universes of sound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99845d04451ced0fc1c0ebf43a679c60a62fd864","amp;dn":"Dense+-+Cookies+%282015%29+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99845d04451ced0fc1c0ebf43a679c60a62fd864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,132,93,4,69,28,237,15,193,192,235,244,58,103,156,96,166,47,216,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
