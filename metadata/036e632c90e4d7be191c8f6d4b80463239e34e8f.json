Based on the newest video compression standard, DivX HEVC strives to deliver up to 50% better compression than its H.264-based predecessor, DivX Plus HD.\n\n DivX 10 is the first software of its kind to integrate support for HEVC video across its products, including Player, Web Player and ConverterÃ¢â‚¬â€providing a free, all-in-one solution for HEVC video.\n DivX Player delivers real-time, high quality HEVC playback of HM11 encoded video up to 1080p\n DivX Web Player enables efficient HEVC video streaming featuring progressive playback and download in your browser \n DivX Converter offers free, simple conversion to DIVX, MKV, MP4 and includes including new DivX HEVC 720p and 1080p video profiles\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n HEVC (H.265)\n\n With the free DivX HEVC Plug-in, you can experience the latest video standard for quality and compression. By using the new DivX HEVC profiles supported in DivX Converter, Player and Web Player, you can create DivX HEVC videos in MKV at file sizes smaller than H.264 and watch DivX HEVC videos on any computer and in your favorite browser. HEVC, or H.265 is the successor to H.264 and strives to deliver video with equivalent quality with bitrate savings of up to 50 percent. HEVC is critical for streaming high quality video even in congested network environments, and will be a driving factor in the delivery of 4K content to new Ultra HD displays.\n\n H.264\n\n H.264 is a popular standard for high definition digital video, and for good reason. A codec based on the H.264 standard compresses a digital video file so that it only uses half the space of MPEG-2 (the DVD standard), to deliver the same quality video. This means you can enjoy stunning HD video the way it was meant to be seen without sacrificing speed or performance. DivX PlusÃ‚Â® video is based on the H.264 standard, which boasts efficient encoding of HD video and powerful features that enable the delivery of high-quality video at very low data rates. Using DivX Plus Converter, you can create stunning DivX Plus HD video (H.264 video wrapped in an MKV container).\n\n MKV\n\n MKV is a flexible, open standard video file format that has quickly become the preferred file extension for high definition video on the Internet. The MKV container can include video, audio, and features such as alternate audio tracks, multilingual subtitles and chapter points, as well as rich metadata including cover art, ratings, descriptions and more. MKV offers a richer media experience than any other current format, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we chose it as the file container for DivX PlusÃ‚Â® video.\n\n MP4\n\n MP4 is a file extension based on the H.264 standard, most commonly used in the creation of standard definition digital video. Popular on the Internet and supported on a range of consumer electronics devices, including iPhoneÃ‚Â®, iPadÃ‚Â® and more, MP4 provides high-quality, highly compressed digital video. The MP4 container can hold video with AAC or AC3 audio.\n\n AVI\n\n AVI is a popular container file format used for watching standard definition video on the PC and is the container used by DivX video versions 3 through 6. AVI files can hold different types of video and audio streams inside, and with the help of DivXÃ‚Â® video compression technology, they can display incredible video quality while maintaining a small file size. .divx files are also based on the AVI container, but can contain additional features like XSUB subtitles and chapters. Both AVI and DIVX videos will play on all DivX Certified devicesÃ¢â‚¬â€from tablets to TVs.\n\n MPEG-2\n\n MPEG-2 is a digital video standard upon which DVD and ATSC video is based and refers to video files with TS, VOB, MPG and SVCD extensions. Buying MPEG-2/DVD Plug-in adds MPEG-2 video support to Converter, which means you can convert MPG, TS, VOB and SVCD filesÃ¢â‚¬â€retaining visual quality while drastically reducing video size.\n\n \n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : Multilanguage\n \n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\n\n1.
