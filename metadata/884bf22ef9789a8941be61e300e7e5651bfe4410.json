Rel. Sept 21, 2004    \n  \n\nFormat:\t      DVD5 NTSC-USA\nLang.:\t      English\nDiscs:         1\nImage:         ISO\nRequirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc method. \n\n\nCompressed with WinRar. Game was tested and works.\nTry 7Zip its free google it, if you don't have WinRar.\n\n\nNote: No Ps2 Backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is\n      Modded or if you use Swap Magic.\n\n\nSince every download link I could find was only in Pal format, I wanted to upload the Ntsc version. This is a straight rip from the original Retail Game Disc.\n\n\nYou could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or Tayio Yuden, burn at 8x if its a 16x max. You really can't use Maxell DVD+R for example or some other brand as it more than likely will not work.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nIn Second Sight, you are John Vattic, a man who has lost his memory but finds himself gifted with awesome psychic powers. Searching for lost past, Vattic soon finds himself investigating a brutal military mission that took place deep in Siberia. Somehow he is linked to this place and its events, and what he soon finds is a headache greater than he could have imagined. But John Vattic has got the second sight and a second chance to make things right. Developed by the creators of TimeSplitters and the N64 GoldenEye, Second Sight is a paranormal psycho-adventure perfect for mystery and action fans. \n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nIf you come across problems or have questions, please post a comment.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter or ImgBurn, (Included in downloaded). \n(If Imgburn doesnt work or game won't load use DVD Decrypter to burn with).  \n\nBest to burn at half speed of max disc write rate, if 16x burn at 8x etc.\n\n\nThe Media you use does matter, best recommended DVD Discs to burn Ps2 games on are Taiyo Yuden, Verbatim, or Ritek Ridata.  (IF DVD+R Then Book-Type it to DVD-ROM).\n\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthly).\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884bf22ef9789a8941be61e300e7e5651bfe4410","amp;dn":"Second+Sight+%5BNtsc%5D+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884bf22ef9789a8941be61e300e7e5651bfe4410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,75,242,46,249,120,154,137,65,190,97,227,0,231,229,101,27,254,68,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
