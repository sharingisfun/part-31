P. Kalonji\n\nJ. P. Kalonji wields a clean, street-informed style to deliver a tale that glistens with blood and drama, yet is ultimately uplifting. Nearly four-hundred pages long, this graphic novel employs full-page panels to tell the story of an Edo-era swordsman's quest for survival and enlightenment. When Ningen leaves his dojo at the request of his master - to travel the world and grow as a swordsman - he embarks on a journey that becomes a metaphor for the cycle of life and every human's spiritual growth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVisually, this book looks VERY much like Jeff Smith's 'Bone' or 'Rasl', sometimes uncannily so. Good story, though. And it's a serious &quot;page turner&quot; - the 390 plus pages fly by pretty fast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b0d64f5f2b7854108acaf243a2086d4401e0672","amp;dn":"365+Samurai+and+a+Few+Bowls+of+Rice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b0d64f5f2b7854108acaf243a2086d4401e0672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,13,100,245,242,183,133,65,8,172,175,36,58,32,134,212,64,30,6,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
