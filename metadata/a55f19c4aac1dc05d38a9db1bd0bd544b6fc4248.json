He also waged an ongoing war against the Claw, nearly killing the villain on at least one occasion. Ultimately, the Claw still managed to survive.\n\nThe Ghost had no powers, but he did have the high-tech Ghost Plane, which was armed with machine guns. In addition to being a skilled pilot, the Ghost was an exceptional and fearless athlete and acrobat. He sometimes carried grenades.\n\nGolden Age Appearances  \nDaredevil Comics #5-20\n\n\nReal Name\n\nBrad Hendricks\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDaredevil Comics #5 (Nov 1941)\n\nOriginal Publisher\n\nLev Gleason\n\nCreated by\n\nBob Wood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55f19c4aac1dc05d38a9db1bd0bd544b6fc4248","amp;dn":"The+Ghost+Collection+COMPLETE+1941+Lev+Gleason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55f19c4aac1dc05d38a9db1bd0bd544b6fc4248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,95,25,196,170,193,220,5,211,138,157,177,189,11,213,68,182,252,66,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
