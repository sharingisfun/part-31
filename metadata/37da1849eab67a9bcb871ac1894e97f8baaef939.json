Robyn,&quot; the billing was reversed when the song was released as a non-album single for the singer, later included on the British and American editions of her self-titled comeback album and becoming her first number one hit in the U.K. in the summer of 2007. Despite the switch-up, Kleerup gained plenty of attention from the track, whose epic, shimmering synthesizers and slow-burning midtempo pulse turned out be consistent sonic signatures of his work. Also a member of the synth pop trio the Meat Boys (who had remixed the Tough Alliance as well as Robyn's &quot;Be Mine&quot;), and a studio drummer who'd played for the Teddybears and Melody Club, among others, Kleerup produced a string of remixes in 2007 for a veritable who's who of Swedish pop Ã¢â‚¬â€ Roxette, the Cardigans, the Concretes, Shout Out Louds Ã¢â‚¬â€ as well as Mika and Just Jack. His self-titled debut album appeared in 2008 and included &quot;With Every Heartbeat&quot; as well as similarly-styled tracks with vocal performances from Lykke Li, Marit Bergman, half-sisters Neneh Cherry and Titiyo, and the Concretes' Lisa Milberg. &quot;Lay Me Down,&quot; a song he co-wrote and produced for Cyndi Lauper's 2008 album Bring Ya to the Brink, was not included, but it appeared in a modified, largely instrumental version, as &quot;Thank You for Nothing.&quot; ~ K.
