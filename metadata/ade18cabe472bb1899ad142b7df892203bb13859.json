The series was originally published by Gorilla Comics, a company formed by Mark Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others, but the company folded after only two issues were produced. Empire was completed under the DC Comics label but is in its own distinct universe.\n\n\n\n\nAs always, please be patient as I don&amp;#039;t have the most amazing upload speeds and please seed to at least 1:1.\n\nEnjoy =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade18cabe472bb1899ad142b7df892203bb13859","amp;dn":"Empire+%2300+-+06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade18cabe472bb1899ad142b7df892203bb13859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,225,140,171,228,114,187,24,153,173,20,43,125,248,146,32,59,177,56,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
