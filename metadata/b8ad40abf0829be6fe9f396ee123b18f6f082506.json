Perched on an icy ledge with no food and water, and unable to move, they were exposed to the elements for five days. Jamie Andrew was eventually rescued by helicopter in one of the most dramatic missions in the history of the Alps. But his friend was less fortunate - by the time the rescue services found them, Jamie Fisher had frozen to death.\nJamie was rushed to hospital with hypothermia and severe frostbite. A few days later, surgeons had no option but to amputate his limbs. For many this would mean the end of all hope, but not for Jamie. With the help of physiotherapy and prosthetics he not only learned to walk again, but within a year began snowboarding. Then came marathons and triathlons, and, perhaps inevitably, he returned to mountaineering.\nNow taking on the biggest challenge of his life, Jamie goes back to the Alps to climb one its most dangerous peaks, the Matterhorn. The perilous nature of the challenge is brought forcefully home during the training period when his partner Roger Payne, one of Britain's leading climbers, is killed in an avalanche. Jamie knows better than most that mountaineering is about making big decisions in extreme conditions. The Limbless Mountaineer follows this extraordinarily determined man as he pursues his dream.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7106/ai6j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7106/ai6j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8698/8s0n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8698/8s0n.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/603/nb2d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/603/nb2d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2790/aw0j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2790/aw0j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8144/ye7z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8144/ye7z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/3262/k4ae.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/3262/k4ae.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4928/7l09.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4928/7l09.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7204/0v2v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7204/0v2v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1334/mr6k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/1334/mr6k.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2916/kp0d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2916/kp0d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1541/j0ft.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1541/j0ft.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/4001/s852.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/4001/s852.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2c64454b446c6018021d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2999 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 1.00 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/the-limbless-mountaineer/episodes/the-limbless-mountaineer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/the-limbless-mountaineer/episodes/the-limbless-mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mountain%20Of%20Ice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mountain%20Of%20Ice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Great%20Summits&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Great%20Summits&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ad40abf0829be6fe9f396ee123b18f6f082506","amp;dn":"Ch5+The+Limbless+Mountaineer+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ad40abf0829be6fe9f396ee123b18f6f082506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,173,64,171,240,130,155,230,254,159,57,110,225,35,177,143,111,8,37,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
