Norton et al. (Wiley, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-470-67290-7\r\n\r\nFormulation Engineering of Foods provides an in-depth look at formulation engineering approaches to food processing and product development of healthier, higher-performance foods.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of eye-catching examples, such as low fat and low calorie chocolate, and salt reduction strategies in products like cheese and sauces, the book is at once easy to relate to and innovative. Presenting new methods and techniques for engineering food products, this book is cutting edge and as food formulation is a new method of food science, this is a timely publication in the field.\r\n\r\nAll three editors are based in the University of Birmingham, base of the largest Chemical Engineering-based food research group in the UK, incorporating research into structured foods, flavour delivery and food hygiene. Research in food processing is carried out in partnership with key companies such as NestlÃ©, Unilever and Cadbury, as well as through funding from research councils and DEFRA. Joint research and collaboration has been carried out with Food Science departments at Nottingham, Leeds and Reading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c484fdde084cb1d38cc649ac5dbadc21c206eb37","amp;dn":"Formulation+Engineering+of+Foods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c484fdde084cb1d38cc649ac5dbadc21c206eb37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,132,253,222,8,76,177,211,140,198,73,172,93,186,220,33,194,6,235,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
