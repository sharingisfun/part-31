Popper criticizes and indicts as totalitarian Plato, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx for relying on historicism to underpin their political philosophies, though his interpretations of all three philosophers have been criticized. Written during World War II, The Open Society and Its Enemies was first printed in London by Routledge in 1945. Originally published in two volumes, &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot; and &quot;The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx, and the Aftermath&quot;, a one volume edition with a new introduction by Alan Ryan and an essay by E. H. Gombrich was published by Princeton University Press in 2013. \r\n\r\nThe work was on the Modern Library Board's 100 Best Nonfiction books of the 20th century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c8bbabd850db187f2d5c5b314412ea2346f300b","amp;dn":"The+Open+Society+and+Its+Enemies+-+Karl+Popper+%5BMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c8bbabd850db187f2d5c5b314412ea2346f300b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,139,186,189,133,13,177,135,242,213,197,179,20,65,46,162,52,111,48,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
