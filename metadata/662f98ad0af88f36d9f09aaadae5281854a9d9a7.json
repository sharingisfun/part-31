I Don't Like to Work\n\nIf all Commander Cody ever aspired to was sounding like a real good Dave Dudley 45, then ex-Lost Planet Airman Bill Kirchen has achieved his dream with this album. The kickoff track, &quot;Womb to the Tomb,&quot; would have fit in atmospherically just about anywhere on those early albums, and his rendition here of the Sharps/Rivingtons with Duane Eddy title track seems absolutely tailor-made for Kirchen's twanging roadhouse style. It's like a night in a real good honky tonk with a great little combo up there. There's a lot of great music on this 14-track outing, with the lion's share of it emanating from Kirchen and his tighter-than-Jack Benny rhythm section of Johnny Castle on bass and Jack O'Dell on drums. No big names doing meaningless guest appearances, just some friends adding some horns, some keys, and a little steel guitar. Records seldom come this simple and unaffected, but Kirchen pulls it off with style and grace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662f98ad0af88f36d9f09aaadae5281854a9d9a7","amp;dn":"Bill+Kirchen+-+Have+Love%2C+Will+Travel+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662f98ad0af88f36d9f09aaadae5281854a9d9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,47,152,173,10,248,143,54,217,240,154,170,218,229,40,24,84,169,217,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
