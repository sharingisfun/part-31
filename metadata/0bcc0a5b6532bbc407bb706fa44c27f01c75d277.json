Pros And Cons was passed on by the band, and\nRoger would later release it as a solo album. The Wall would become a magnum \nopus and watermark for all concept records to follow. This CD released in 2001,\ncontains the entire set of demos that Roger recorded, performing all vocals, \nguitar, bass, keyboards and drum machine tracks. UNBELIEVABLE stuff, with many\nalternate lyrics! Complete demo tracks for The Wall album. Composed at \nBritannia Row Studios, Islington, UK\n\nThis CD has lyrical and musical arrangements that those who have heard the box set will be familiar with, however, it expands on the snippets of songs we were given on Immersion and as the album progresses completely new takes on a lot of songs. \n\nThe Album is presented with songs in order making for a more satisfying listening experience.  Quality wise, while it does not reach the standard set by the 2011 remasters, it is excellent....  a really enjoyable experience for any Pink Floyd fan.  \n\n\nTrack Listing here: http://bayimg.com/jaoFfaadd\n\n\nENJOY! \n\nBeolab1700","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bcc0a5b6532bbc407bb706fa44c27f01c75d277","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Building+the+Wall+DEMOS%282001%29%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bcc0a5b6532bbc407bb706fa44c27f01c75d277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,204,10,91,101,50,187,196,7,187,112,111,164,76,39,240,28,117,210,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
