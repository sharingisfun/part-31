In April 1999, a Colombian label offered to release all the band's demos and unreleased rare recordings on CD (Seven Years of Decay, 1999).\n\nThe second album, Stabwound Orgasm (1999) was recorded at Spacelab Studios in Kempen, Germany and was mastered by James Murphy in California. Again released by Repulse, this album doubled the sales of its predecessor and was licensed by various labels in South America (Sylphorium), USA/Canada (World War III) and Russia (IronD). In January 2001, the band entered the studios again, this time with producer Roberto GalÃƒÂ¡n to record four cover songs for different tribute albums which were finally put together as a self-financed MCD (Bloodcovered, 2001) in a limited run of 500 copies available only through the band.\n\nIn August 2002, the band travelled again to Germany's Spacelab Studios to record their third album, Yearning for the Grotesque which came out in February 2003 through the Italian label Avantgarde Music.\n\nThe band's fourth full-length album, Gorespattered Suicide was recorded in Madrid at VRS Studios and the masters were later sent to Erik Rutan of Hate Eternal / ex-Morbid Angel who mixed and mastered the album at his Mana Recording Studios at Florida. It was released in January 2005 by Slovakian label Metal Age Productions. This was followed by a tour in Japan (April 2005), European festivals including London Deathfest, Obscene Extreme (Czech Republic), Uncover Train Fest (Paris), plus a complete European tour (15 shows/11 countries) as headliners together with Italian grindcore act Grimness 69.\n\nReanimations (2006) was released by Xtreem Music and shortly after also by Metal Age Productions. It included two new songs, a new version from an earlier demo song, three covers (of WASP, Gorefest and Exodus), plus eight bands performing Avulsed cover songs. September 2007 saw the first official Avulsed DVD release with Reanimating Russia 2007, recorded in Moscow in June 2007 during the band's second Russian tour, and released by Coyote Records.\n\nAfter three years of touring, Avulsed focussed on their fifth full-length album, Nullo (The Pleasure of Self-Mutilation), recorded in Madrid at Room 101 Studios between October 2008 and May 2009 with Javier FernÃƒÂ¡ndez as engineer and producer. It utilised artwork and design from Mike Hrubovcak. This album was simultaneously released in June 2009 through Xtreem Music and Metal Age in Europe, Coyote in Russia and will see upcoming releases by Ibex Moon Records in the US, American Line in Mexico/Central America and Sylphorium for the South American territory.\n\nIn March 2012 it was announced that drummer Riki had amicably parted ways with the band.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n\n    Dave Rotten Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\n    Cabra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Juancar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Tana Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\n\nPast members\n\n    Lucky (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\n    Antonio Pardo &quot;Toni&quot; (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n    Luisma (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    IvÃƒÂ¡n (1996Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\n    Furni Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n    Javi &quot;El Largo&quot; (1991) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Andy II (2000) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n    Riky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012)\n\nDiscography\n\n    \n   \n    1994: Carnivoracity (7&quot; EP\n    1995: Carnivoracity (mini CD)\n    1996: Eminence in Putrescence (album)\n    1998: Cybergore (re-mixes)\n    1999: Stabwound Orgasm (album)\n    2001: Bloodcovered (mini CD)\n    2003: Yearning for the Grotesque (album)\n    2005: Gorespattered Suicide (album)\n    2006: Reanimations (album)\n    2009: Nullo (The Pleasure of Self-Mutilation) (album)\n    2013: Ritual Zombi (album)\n\n\nNot Included In this compilation\n\n1992: Embalmed in Blood (demo)\n1993: Deformed Beyond Belief (demo)\n1993: Live in Perfect Deformity (live-tape)\n1993: Dead Flesh Compilation (5-Way Split)\n1993: Split 12&quot;LP with Acid Death\n1995: Promo '95 (demo)\n1999: Seven Years of Decay (best-of/compilation)\n2007: Reanimating Russia 2007 (DVD)\n\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da278bd853ad20d69eb707a18adac06e8f798b06","amp;dn":"Avulsed+Discography+%281994-2013%29+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da278bd853ad20d69eb707a18adac06e8f798b06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,39,139,216,83,173,32,214,158,183,7,161,138,218,192,110,143,121,139,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
