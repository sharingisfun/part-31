Bax's rhapsodic genius and brilliant sense of orchestration eventually won him new audiences in the 1980s and 1990s. His Second Symphony was his first largescale work to achieve great popularity, and one of the few that carried over the period when his brand of British Romanticism was out of favor with the serialist establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBio and images included.
