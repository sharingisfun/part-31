He and his family immigrated to Los Angeles in 1975. He studied\nmarketing at California State University and started his own software company\nbefore beginning his music career with the formation of System of a Down in\n1995. In 1998, System of a Down signed on to Rick Rubin's American imprint, and\nover the following seven years released five well-received albums, the second of\nwhich, Toxicity, thrust them into the forefront of the metal community, garnered\na Grammy nomination, and sold millions of copies. Tankian utilized his success\nto influence the political world he often commented on lyrically by co-founding\na nonprofit organization called Axis of Justice with Rage Against the Machine\nand Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello. He remained active with System of a Down\nthroughout the mid-2000s and also released a book of poetry, titled Cool\nGardens, before SOAD chose, in May 2006, to go on hiatus of an undetermined\nlength. Tankian made use of this sabbatical to record his first solo album,\nElect the Dead, which was released in fall 2007. Three years later, Tankian\nteamed up with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra to release Elect the Dead\nSymphony, featuring songs from his solo debut backed by a live orchestra.\nTankian's second solo album, Imperfect Harmonies, continued in the orchestral\nfootsteps symphonically re-imagined debut.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43448c8340255a9ff3392c85ef788e7d12f4263a","amp;dn":"Serj_Tankian-Harakiri_%28Bonus_Tracks%29-WEB-2012-JUST+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43448c8340255a9ff3392c85ef788e7d12f4263a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,68,140,131,64,37,90,159,243,57,44,133,239,120,142,125,18,244,38,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
