When the small town of Kentsburg, Mississippi finds itself cut off from the rest of the outside world following a terrible thunderstorm, no one thinks much of it, although several inhabitants recall seeing flashing red lights on the horizon just before the power went out. The next morning, even stranger things begin to happen.\n\nNobody's car will start, clocks are frozen in time, and all cell phones are mysteriously dead. Then come the drones that some farmers have begun to dig up in their fields--heavy circular devices which house a plethora of deadly weapons to kill anyone who interferes with them.\n\nIn the days following the aftermath of what many refer to as &quot;The Shock&quot;, an unlikely young antihero named Markus Huxley rises, eventually declaring himself de facto leader of a place henceforth known as &quot;Burntown&quot;. Influenced only by his haunted past and an unusual penchant for fire, the future of those who remain in Kentsburg under his reign seems uncertain.\n\nWith the town's older residents dying off, the teens soon turn to drugs and alcohol in order to cope. And so the parties rage on, even as the world has seen fit to end in fire.\n\nStill, there are some who begin investigating by tearing apart the drones--which at first seem to be an alien technology--until a darker, much more shocking truth is revealed concerning a future that may be too late to turn back from...\n\n----------------------\n\nTHIS TORRENT INCLUDES: \n\n- The Chronicles of Burntown, Pt. 1 (Kindle, ePub, PDF formats)\n\n---------------------- \n\nFROM THE AUTHOR: \n\nHello!
