That was for an album, &quot;Bits And Pieces,&quot; which we did with Quincy Jones for Creed (Taylor) when he was at ABC-Paramount. We were given the arrangements just before recording. It was to be a big band album, and we didn't get a chance to hear the whole thing until the moment we got into the studio, We went ahead with it anyway, but the album wasn't as good as we'd like it to have been&quot;\n-Jackie Cain\n\nDespite of the inclusion of a disconcertingly pleasant rendition of &quot;Dixie&quot;, &quot;Free &amp; Easy&quot; really is a better, more Jackie &amp; Roy-esque album.\n\nBoth sound great on this Fresh Sound reissue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9710c2044c0cbfce68c0ac9468281831a095b07f","amp;dn":"Jackie+%26amp%3B+Roy+-+Bits+%26amp%3B+Pieces+%2B+Free+%26amp%3B+Easy+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9710c2044c0cbfce68c0ac9468281831a095b07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,16,194,4,76,12,191,206,104,192,172,148,104,40,24,49,160,149,176,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
