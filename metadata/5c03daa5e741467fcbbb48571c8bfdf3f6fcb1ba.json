Analytical Troubleshooting of Process Machinery and Pressure Vessels provides both students and engineering professionals with the tools necessary for understanding and solving equipment problems in today's complex processing environment.\r\n\r\nDrawing on forty years of industrial experience in the petrochemical, transportation, and component manufacturing industries, the author introduces analytical models that utilize simple mathematics to provide engineers with the information needed to understand equipment operation and failure modes. This will allow engineering professionals to talk intelligibly with manufacturers, implement modifications required for continued operation, and ultimately help them save millions of dollars in lost production or warranty claims.\r\n\r\nReaders will find in-depth coverage of factors that can cause equipment failure, including:\r\n* Component wear and fretting\r\n* Vibration of machines and piping\r\n* Instabilities and sizing of pumps and compressors\r\n* Thermal loads and stresses\r\n* Gear, bearing, shafting, and coupling loading\r\n* Corrosion and materials of construction\r\n\r\nBy striking a balance between analytical and practical considerations, each potential problem area is illustrated with case studies taken from the author's own extensive experience and accompanied by methods that can be used to address a variety of related challenges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c03daa5e741467fcbbb48571c8bfdf3f6fcb1ba","amp;dn":"Analytical+Troubleshooting+of+Process+Machinery+and+Pressure+Ves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c03daa5e741467fcbbb48571c8bfdf3f6fcb1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,3,218,165,231,65,70,127,203,187,72,87,28,139,253,243,246,252,177,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
