All iOS 6 users are free to upgrade to iOS 7 now, however this release has even caught saurik (Jay Freeman) the maintainer of Cydia off guard as he claims Cydia has not been tested thoroughly and Mobile Substrate do not work correctly. So all of our favorite tweaks probably do not work yet. As always, please backup your device first.\n\nSo, I got no lead time on evasi0n7, nor was I asked for an official iOS 7 Cydia; I was not given builds, nor was I asked for things to test.\n\nIn fact, @evad3rs didn't even try my testing build of Substrate I gave core developers, so they didn't notice a fundamental incompatibility.\n\nThis means they are going to have to push a new version of their untether to fix this oversight before I can push newer builds of Substrate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60416703fff4a02edadfb2c18c2d44087c9b82d9","amp;dn":"evasi0n7+-+iOS+7.x+Jailbreak+windows+only+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60416703fff4a02edadfb2c18c2d44087c9b82d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,65,103,3,255,244,160,46,218,223,178,193,140,45,68,8,124,155,130,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
