One of the most striking things about Cope is how he at once incorporates any range of &amp;#039;60s and &amp;#039;70s influences, high profile or obscure, and is able to turn them all into his own sound, high on life (and other things, no doubt) and bursting with creative energy. Even his supposedly lost years documented on World Shut Your Mouth and Fried find him hitting new heights, as &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot; and &quot;An Elegant Chaos&quot; show. Extensive liner notes from his longtime friend and confidant Mick Houghton give a nicely off-kilter history of the man and his work, while a selection of photos, press clips and other ephemera help trace the path further. Those intrigued by the antiquarian side of Cope&amp;#039;s life will appreciate the artistic map of his hometown, Tamworth, with reference to the various album covers and promo shots taken there over time. Peggy Suicide remains Cope&amp;#039;s best standalone album, but Floored Genius is crucial at showing the heights of his work. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01. Reward                                        \n02.
