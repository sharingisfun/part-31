Rolling Stone called it the &quot;Singer-Songwriter Debut of the Year&quot; and other critics were equally generous with their praise. Despite the critical reception and numerous artists covering her songs, Ms. Waldman simply failed to catch on. A few more albums for Warners followed before Ms. Waldman more or less slipped back into obscurity. Try this out and PLEASE seed for a while.
