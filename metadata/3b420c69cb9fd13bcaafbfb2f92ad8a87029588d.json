Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.\n\n@1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.\n@2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).\n@3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.\n+++\n@S. Special, usually dedicated to one artist.\n\nOnly the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled HQ MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time....\n\nEnjoy and try seeding, its more fun than you think.\n \nSpecs missing: (Too) large specs will not be accepted (DB Errors)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b420c69cb9fd13bcaafbfb2f92ad8a87029588d","amp;dn":"Indie+Playlists+1207+-+July+2012+%28Dutch+Treat+HQ+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b420c69cb9fd13bcaafbfb2f92ad8a87029588d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,66,12,105,203,159,209,59,202,175,191,178,249,42,216,168,112,41,88,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
