Though Lewis had seemingly done enough to win, the bout was declared a draw, with one judge ruling the fight in favor of Lewis 116Ã¢â‚¬â€œ113, another scoring the fight in Holyfield's favor with a score of 115Ã¢â‚¬â€œ113 and the third declaring the fight even at 115Ã¢â‚¬â€œ115.[1] The ruling became one of the most controversial in boxing history, and as such, the three sanctioning bodies quickly ordered a rematch between the two.[2] A week after their controversial first fight, Holyfield and Lewis officially agreed to the rematch, with the fight's $30 million purse being evenly split between the two fighters.[3] The match was originally scheduled for September, but it was later pushed back to November 13, with Las Vegas' Thomas &amp; Mack Center being announced as the site of the fight.[4] Ironically, the fight would take place exactly seven years after Riddick Bowe had defeated Holyfield to become the last Undisputed Heavyweight champion. In addition to the four titles the two men held being on the line, the vacant IBO Heavyweight title was also up for grabs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe046dee3d4d0872d7d4f3364ec0c16a7eb1e848","amp;dn":"Evander+Holyfield+vs+Lennox+Lewis+II.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe046dee3d4d0872d7d4f3364ec0c16a7eb1e848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,4,109,238,61,77,8,114,215,212,243,54,78,192,193,106,126,177,232,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
