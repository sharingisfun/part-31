Here's Desert Moon Song by Dean Evenson, released in 1991. Unfortunately, its quality is not as good as that of the other 2 albums (128kbps), but hey, it's better than nothing. Hope you like it.\n\nI'll stop with the new agefaggotry for now. I don't want to look like someone who owns a Prius.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5f8d505fafd561a67b87a3b4ac6587be41d131","amp;dn":"Dean+Evenson+-+%5B1991%5D+Desert+Moon+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5f8d505fafd561a67b87a3b4ac6587be41d131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,95,141,80,95,175,213,97,166,123,135,163,180,172,101,135,190,65,209,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
