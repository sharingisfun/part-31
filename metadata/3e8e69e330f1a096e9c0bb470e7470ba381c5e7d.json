Drawing on his own research with Carmelite nuns, neuroscientist Mario \n\nBeauregard shows that genuine, life-changing spiritual events can be documented. He \n\noffers compelling evidence that religious experiences have a nonmaterial origin, making a \n\nconvincing case for what many in scientific fields are loath to consider - that it is God who \n\ncreates our spiritual experiences, not the brain.\n\nScientific materialism is at a loss to explain irrefutable accounts of mind over matter, of \n\nintuition, willpower, and leaps of faith, of the &amp;#039;placebo effect&amp;#039; in medicine, of near-death \n\nexperiences on the operating table, and of psychic premonitions of a loved one in crisis, to \n\nsay nothing of the occasional sense of oneness with nature and mystical experiences on \n\nmeditation or prayer. Traditional science explains away these and other occurrences as \n\ndelusions or misunderstanding, but by exploring the latest neurological research on \n\nphonemona such as these, The Spiritual Brain get to their real source.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8e69e330f1a096e9c0bb470e7470ba381c5e7d","amp;dn":"The+Spiritual+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8e69e330f1a096e9c0bb470e7470ba381c5e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,142,105,227,48,241,160,150,233,192,187,71,14,116,112,186,56,28,94,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
