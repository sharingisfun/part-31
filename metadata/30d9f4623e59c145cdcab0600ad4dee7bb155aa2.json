Yet in the 19th century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a century when there were many great individual discoveries in medicine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the contributions of four individuals in particular accelerated developments in each of the main branches of medicine. This medical history by Thomas Dormandy focuses on these four individuals and their &quot;moments of truth&quot; - Laennec, a French physician; Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician; Lister, a Scottish surgeon; and Walter Reed, an American army pathologist. They are not well known, compared with their contemporaries in other walks of life, yet their moments of truth transformed the lives of millions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d9f4623e59c145cdcab0600ad4dee7bb155aa2","amp;dn":"Moments+of+Truth%3A+Four+Creators+of+Modern+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d9f4623e59c145cdcab0600ad4dee7bb155aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,217,244,98,62,89,193,69,205,202,176,96,10,212,222,231,187,21,90,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
