The book covers basic anatomy and the physiology of canine olfaction along with some of the unique characteristics that allow a dog to work.\r\n\r\nUsing concise and understandable explanations along with numerous photographs, the book covers the stages of decomposition and how they are affected by the environment; what is currently understood about the chemical profile of odor from human remains; how weather, topography, ground cover and terrain can affect odor dispersion; and different types of mapping and weather data that can be used before and during deployment of the HRD K9.\r\n\r\nThe final chapter ties it all together by providing case reports about decedents who have been found in different locations in a variety of environmental conditions. By learning how these variables can affect how and what is found, handlers and investigators will be better prepared to meet the challenges of their jobs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39164acfe7e1cbe53cc264f067567b3a965b8c8","amp;dn":"Death%2C+Decomposition+and+Detector+Dogs+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39164acfe7e1cbe53cc264f067567b3a965b8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,145,100,172,254,126,28,190,83,204,38,79,6,117,103,179,169,101,184,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
