The book will doubtless be highly popular in the schools of America. However, the story is not didactic. There is no preaching. Ships did help make America and there was never a dull moment in the making. No other phase of our American epic is more exciting, has more drama or appeal to every red-blooded American. Without ships our rivers would have remained streams, our continent would never have been joined politically. We might well have become another Europe, torn by rivalries, peopled by a dozen different nations, speaking different languages, raising customs walls and other barriers between one another. It is obvious that the sixty-one excellent pen-and-ink sketches by the author were a labor of love. They add much to making the book a continuous whole, aside from their own merit. They have remarkable motion and give zest to the text. Combined with the book's personalized ship histories, they make for a rounded and worthy addition to every man's bookshelf of Americana","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe27082f9ca98c880e45dfb9a7e69765434b0a91","amp;dn":"Famous+American+Ships+%28Sea+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe27082f9ca98c880e45dfb9a7e69765434b0a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,39,8,47,156,169,140,136,14,69,223,185,167,230,151,101,67,75,10,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
