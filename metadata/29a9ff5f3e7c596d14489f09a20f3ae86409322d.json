It\\\\\\'s like Jim Cramer and Dr. Dre had triplets. \n\nPreviously known for their on stage antics and high tech digital displays in gritty New York clubs, this group has finally broken out of the local and hit the world with their release of The Prospectus EP. One fan described their live show as \\\\\\&quot;better than Wu-Tang\\\\\\&quot; which they humbly accepted although, being fans of the Clan themselves, they may not totally agree. \n\nThe topics tackled in this EP include the recent government bailout of the automotive and financial industries, dealing with and surviving a bear market (bears are quite dangerous, y\\\\\\'know?), living it up in the decadence that can be New York City, knowing where they come from, and the plight and perils of being a rap group in today\\\\\\'s society - three members strong (not necessarily in this order).\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\t  1.
