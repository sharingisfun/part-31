Berra, &quot;Charles Darwin: The Concise Story of an Extraordinary Man&quot;\n2008 | ISBN-10: 0801891043 | 144 pages | PDF | 4 MB\n\nTwo hundred years after Charles Darwin's birth (February 12, 1809), this thoroughly illustrated, yet concise biography reveals the great scientist as husband, father, and friend.\n\nTim M. Berra, whose &quot;Darwin: The Man&quot; lectures are in high demand worldwide, tells the fascinating story of the person and the idea that changed everything. Berra discusses Darwin's revolutionary scientific work, its impact on modern-day biological science, and the influence of Darwin's evolutionary theory on Western thought. But Berra digs deeper to reveal Darwin the man by combining anecdotes with carefully selected illustrations and photographs.\n\nThis small gem of a book includes 20 color plates and 60 black-and-white illustrations, along with an annotated list of Darwin's publications and a chronology of his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb2cd2edcf4e4b285e9587eda6f5a5f98ec6e9f","amp;dn":"Charles+Darwin%3A+The+Concise+Story+of+an+Extraordinary+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb2cd2edcf4e4b285e9587eda6f5a5f98ec6e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,178,205,46,220,244,228,178,133,233,88,126,218,111,90,95,152,236,110,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
