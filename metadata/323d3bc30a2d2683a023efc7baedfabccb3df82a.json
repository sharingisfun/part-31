I'm not sure. This is all of their songs available on the internet (and some not, I assume) in one compiled tracklist. \n\n\nAll files have been normalized for likeness in volume, as these were mostly pulled from different sources. These songs are partially from a disc sent to a friend of mine directly from a guy in the band (I think?). \n\n\nTo my knowledge, they had only one official release, the EP &quot;Scientists Of The World&quot;. This entire disc is included in this compilation. \n\n\nThis band is no more, but I hope someday some guy in this band finds this compilation in a torrent or something and is surprised at the small but faithful following they have/had.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323d3bc30a2d2683a023efc7baedfabccb3df82a","amp;dn":"Friday+Night+Bingo+%28New+Jersey+Ska+Punk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323d3bc30a2d2683a023efc7baedfabccb3df82a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,61,59,195,10,45,38,131,160,35,239,199,186,237,250,188,203,61,248,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
