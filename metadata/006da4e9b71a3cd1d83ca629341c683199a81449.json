He was featured on Joe Liggins' million selling R&amp;B classic The Honeydripper. \n\nLiggins and Jackson had started working together in the mid 1930s as members of the resident jazz band at the Creole Palace, a hot San Diego night spot. By 1940, both musicians had moved north to Los Angeles to join that city's thriving music scene. In 1944 they got back together to form their own group and a year later recorded the seminal The Honeydripper Pts 1 &amp; 2 which went on to become the biggest selling R&amp;B record of 1945.\n\nHere you have 24 classic recordings from the late 1940s, half of them previously unissued, all transferred with loving care from the original master lacquers.
