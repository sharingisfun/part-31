It somehow reminds me of Diary of a Madman.\n\n&quot;Being There&quot; is said to be inspired by this story, in fact Jerzy Kosinski was accused of outright plagiarism - compare for yourself. I see similar themes, but very different stories about different sorts of people.\n\nI got this off youtube, thus it is in flv format - it will play on VLC. Youtube sometimes takes things down, so I will post it here.\n\nAnyone got English subs?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcb25f164aa7703ba062fd631d47c02ad4f5f89","amp;dn":"Nikodem+Dyzma+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcb25f164aa7703ba062fd631d47c02ad4f5f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,203,37,241,100,170,119,3,186,6,47,214,49,212,124,2,173,79,95,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
