Since then, violinist Mary Rowell, has joined the group, which continues its live concert and club performances. &quot;The playing is impeccable in accuracy, verve, and dynamics,&quot; says SPIN magazine. &quot;The balance is perfect so that each instrument adds its own distinct voice.&quot;\n\nThis is the album that gave inspiration to the later Gotan Project. Features some classics, most notably Gardel's &quot;Por Una Cabeza&quot;, which is used in Scent Of A Woman for Pacino's dancing scene.\n\n \t\nA1 \tLa Cumparsita\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gerardo Matos RodrÃƒÂ­guez \n\n\t5:00\n\nA2 \tPor Una Cabeza\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Carlos Gardel \n\n\t2:13\n\nA3 \tYira Yira\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Enrique Santos DiscÃƒÂ©polo \n\n\t2:20\n\nA4 \tLa Violetera\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ JosÃƒÂ© Padilla* \n\n\t3:33\n\nA5 \tCaminito\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Juan de DiÃƒÂ³s Filiberto* \n\n\t2:14\n\nA6 \tRetintÃƒÂ­n\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eduardo Arolas \n\n\t2:55\n\nA7 \tChalita\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Victor Schertzinger \n\n\t3:12\n\nB1 \tEl Choclo\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Angel Villoldo \n\n\t2:59\n\nB2 \tVida Mia\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Emilio Fresedo, Osvaldo Fresedo \n\n\t2:43\n\nB3 \tA Media Luz\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Edgardo Donato \n\n\t2:12\n\nB4 \tEl Esquinazo\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Angel Villoldo \n\n\t2:28\n\nB5 \tAdiÃƒÂ³s, Muchachos\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Julio CÃƒÂ©sar Sanders* \n\n\t2:23\n\nB6 \tJalousie\n\n    Composed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jacob Gade \n\n\t5:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece25104e757970651e3f54cb65419b788cd9f3f","amp;dn":"The+Tango+Project+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece25104e757970651e3f54cb65419b788cd9f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,226,81,4,231,87,151,6,81,227,245,76,182,84,25,183,136,205,159,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
