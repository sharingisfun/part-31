Hines debuted, at the age of sixteen, in the Australian version of the stage musical Hair and followed with the role of Mary Magdalene in Jesus Christ Superstar. She achieved her greatest commercial successes as a recording artist during the late 1970s with several hit singles, including cover versions of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself&quot;, &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Something's Missing&quot;; and her Top Ten albums Marcia Shines, Shining and Ladies and Gentlemen. Hines was voted 'Queen of Pop' by TV Week's readers for three consecutive years from 1976.\n\nHines stopped recording in the early 1980s until she returned with Right Here and Now in 1994, the same year she became an Australian citizen.She was the subject of the 2001 biography Diva: the life of Marcia Hines which coincided with the release of the album, Diva. Since 2003 she has been a judge on Australian Idol, and her elevated profile led to a renewed interest in her as a performer. Her 2006 album, Discotheque, peaked at #6 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums chart.\n\nHines is the mother of singer Deni Hines, with whom she performed on the duet single &quot;Stomp!&quot; (2006). Hines lives near Newcastle, New South Wales with Christopher Morrissey, her husband since 2005.
