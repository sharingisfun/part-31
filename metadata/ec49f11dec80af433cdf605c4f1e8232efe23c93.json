A staggering 15% of all the world's species are found in this unique region.\n\nThe island chain straddles the equator it is a country forged by fire. Violent volcanic eruptions account for many of the islands, some huge, others merely a speck of rock. These islands are a centre of bio-diversity that is matched nowhere else in the world.
