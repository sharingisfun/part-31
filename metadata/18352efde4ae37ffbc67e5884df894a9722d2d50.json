And this one meets those criteria perfectly.\n\nMike Clayton has managed to crystallise a large number of models, theories and ideas and focus them all on the topic of Ã¢â‚¬ËœHandling ResistanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ so this book is great if you want to swot up when you know youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to deal with a challenging proposal, sales call or meeting. And there are plenty of ideas in there too that would apply just as well outside work.\n\nHe starts with an Ã¢â‚¬ËœonionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ model for handling resistance which recurs throughout the book. This provided a useful step by step approach to break down the hurdles, rather than being faced with blanket resistance and then not knowing where to begin.\n\nHe considers how resistance is part of a process and therefore natural, so gives you ways to work with it rather than fight it. There are sections on staying in harmony with other people and some useful ideas on how to reframe a situation. Change and Sales Objections are covered specifically and you will particularly like MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts on getting help, without dropping a colleague in it.\n\nThere are also some reassuring sections on what to do if things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go to plan and you find yourself in an escalating situation.\n\nHaving read this book you will feel much better equipped to handle resistance and  tempted to go out and try it straight away!\n\nCheck this website for more info on the book and the author..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mikeclayton.co.uk/books-2/the-handling-resistance-pocketbook/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mikeclayton.co.uk/books-2/the-handling-resistance-pocketbook/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy ans seed plzzzzz!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18352efde4ae37ffbc67e5884df894a9722d2d50","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Handling+Resistance+Pocketbook+-+Dr.+Mike+Clayton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18352efde4ae37ffbc67e5884df894a9722d2d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,53,46,253,228,174,55,255,188,103,229,136,77,248,148,169,114,45,45,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
