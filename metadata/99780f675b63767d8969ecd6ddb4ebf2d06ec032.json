And Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most charismatic assassin since James BondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (San Francisco Chronicle) is up against his most formidable enemy yet: the nexus of political, military, media, and corporate factions known only as the Oligarchy. \n\nWhen legendary black ops veteran Colonel Scott Ã¢â‚¬Å“HortÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Horton tracks Rain down in Tokyo, Rain canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the offer: a multi-million dollar payday for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“natural causesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demise of three ultra-high-profile targets who are dangerously close to launching a coup in America. \n\nBut the opposition on this job is going to be too much for even Rain to pull it off alone. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need a detachment of other deniable irregulars: his partner, the former Marine sniper, Dox. Ben Treven, a covert operator with ambivalent motives and conflicted loyalties. And Larison, a man with a hair trigger and a secret heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll kill to protect. \n\nFrom the shadowy backstreets of Tokyo and Vienna, to the deceptive glitz and glamour of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and finally to a Washington, D.C. in a permanent state of war, these four lone wolf killers will have to survive presidential hit teams, secret CIA prisons, and a national security state as obsessed with guarding its own secrets as it is with invading the privacy of the populace. \n\nBut first, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to survive each other. \n\nThe Detachment is what fans of Eisler, Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most talented and literary writers in the thriller genreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Chicago Sun-Times), have been waiting for: the worlds of the award-winning Rain series, and of the bestselling Fault Line and Inside Out, colliding in one explosive thriller as real as todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headlines and as frightening as tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99780f675b63767d8969ecd6ddb4ebf2d06ec032","amp;dn":"Barry+Eisler+-+The+Detachment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99780f675b63767d8969ecd6ddb4ebf2d06ec032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,120,15,103,91,99,118,125,137,105,236,214,221,180,235,242,208,110,192,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
