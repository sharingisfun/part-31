It contains:\n\n\n- Black Emporium\n- Mage Item Pack\n- Pre-Order Bonus Items\n- Ring of Whispers\n- Rogue Item Pack\n- Signature Edition Items\n- The Antivan Garrote\n- The Exiled Prince\n- Warrior Item Pack\n\n\nEverything that's not in this list is included too, so don't ask - yes, it's there.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):\n\n\n* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press &quot;Install&quot;;\n\n* You may (depending on an Act you are playing) need to access your Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need to exit the house, and return again;\n\n* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list.\n\n* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking &quot;DragonAge2.exe&quot; file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.\n\n\n\n**********************************************\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to share this everywhere you can and want.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no \nviruses, and have never been any.\n\n\nP.S. I did not inclide a patch 1.03 changelog because it's a very long one. Google it.\n\n\n\n-illiria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34e7b90012fb6aae11552b535d31a9e31d0e6ae1","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+Complete+DLC+Re-Pack+%28with+Patch+1.03%29+-illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34e7b90012fb6aae11552b535d31a9e31d0e6ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,231,185,0,18,251,106,174,17,85,43,83,93,49,169,227,29,14,106,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
