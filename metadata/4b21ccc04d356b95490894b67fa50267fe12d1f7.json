The famous Dingley Dell sequence in his first novel, Pickwick Papers, is an early instance. \n\nA Christmas Carol is obviously his major statement on the theme, an entirely characteristic alignment of the celebratory aspect of the occasion with deeper (and deeply Christian) themes of transformation and redemption. \n\nBut his fascination with Christmas was many layered and included deep nostalgia for what he increasingly thought of as his idyllic childhood. \n\nIn Household Words, the weekly magazine he founded and edited, he contributed a number of highly personal and more or less autobiographical pieces, of which &quot;A Christmas Tree&quot; is one.\n\nLike some of the other pieces of a similar character, it is an almost Proustian meditation on the past, simultaneously full of deep resonances and particular observation, and unexpectedly moving.\n\n\nAbout Simon Callow:\n___\n\nCallow was born in Streatham, London, England, UK, the son of Yvonne Mary (nÃƒÂ©e Guise), a secretary, and Neil Francis Callow, a businessman. His father was of English and French descent and his mother was of Danish and German ancestry. \n\nHe was brought up Roman Catholic. Callow attended the London Oratory School and then went on to study at Queen's University Belfast ('Queen's') in Northern Ireland where he was active in the Northern Ireland civil-rights movement (1960s), \n\nbefore giving up his degree course to go into acting at the Drama Centre London.\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
