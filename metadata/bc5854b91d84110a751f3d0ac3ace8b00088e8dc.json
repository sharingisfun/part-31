Rodney thinks DJ is an ignorant white farm boy, and DJ thinks Rodney acts too smart for his own good. After a school bus scuffle between the two, DJ's father and Rodney's grandmother come up with a clever solution that brings the boys closer than either of them would like. Living in Canaan, Texas in the 1960's does not make it easy for a black boy and a white boy to forge a friendship. It is only amid the magic of an unforgettable Christmas that DJ and Rodney discover a land of milk and honey where hope and love make all the difference.\n\nVideo:\ncodec-xvid\n688x384\n\nAudio:\nvbr mp3 @128/kbs\nsubs - NO\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410013/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410013/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks for choosing cOOt torrents, and enjoy the show!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5854b91d84110a751f3d0ac3ace8b00088e8dc","amp;dn":"Christmas+In+Canaan+2010+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BEng%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5854b91d84110a751f3d0ac3ace8b00088e8dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,88,84,185,29,132,17,10,117,31,61,10,195,172,232,176,0,136,232,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
