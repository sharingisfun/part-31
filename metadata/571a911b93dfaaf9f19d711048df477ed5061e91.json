The orphaned Patsy takes her guardian's advice to heart when she is sent back to the orphanage after Mrs. Patterson's death. Looking to the Bible for guidance, Patsy turns the pages at random and sees the passage &quot;...flee to Egypt.&quot; Taking the words as divine guidance, Patsy runs away to the town of Egypt, New Jersey, where she meets Tommy Wilks, whose father Red is the town drunk. Red takes Patsy to his boss, Tom Creighton, the editor of the town paper, who offers the little girl a home with his own wife and children. When Jim writes an editorial criticizing the safety standards of a paint factory owned by millionaire Luther Marvin, however, he loses his job and brings disaster to the entire family. Believing that she is a jinx, Patsy goes to Marvin's house where she softens the heart of the millionaire's valet, Edwards, who grows fond of her. Although Tommy and Patsy have reformed Red, they are unable help Jim until the town is rocked by an explosion at the paint factory. Jim rushes to the scene of the fire and tries to extinguish it by opening a water tank, but he becomes trapped. Only with the help of the children does Jim manage to escape death. For his heroism, Jim is reinstated in his job and legally adopts Patsy as his daughter.\n\nUplifting Film, strong Moral message\n1 August 2005 | by SumBuddy-3 (San Juan Capistrano, CA) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ See all my reviews\n\nOkay, I'll admit I was in tears watching this film. Virginia Wiedler was a wonderful alternative to the Shirley Temple/Margaret O'Brien acting style, and I really like her sincerity without the &quot;sugar coating&quot; that Shirley and Margaret always added.\n\nWonderful supporting characters, (although more important), since she played an orphan, and was constantly looking for guidance and acceptance. The Father figure, the boyfriend, his alcoholic father, and the other character actors made this a balanced film. Christian overtones wouldn't get it through to the big screen these days, but this was 1939. Late in the Depression, Christian thinking was very strong. Worth watching!\n\nTrivia\nRex, the dog in this movie, was the same dog who played Toto in The Wizard of Oz. \n\nRelease Date\n27 Oct 1939\n\nColor/BW\nBlack and White\n\nSound\nMono (Western Electric Sound System)\n\nProduction Dates\nlate Aug--22 Sep 1939\n\nAlternate Title(s)\nLooking After Sandy\nPatsy\nRunaway Angel\n\n\t\nDuration (in mins)\n72 or 77\n\nDuration (in reels)\n8\n\nPremiere Information\nnot available\nlate Aug--22 Sep 1939\n\n\nDistribution Company\nLoew's Inc.\n\nProduction Company\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571a911b93dfaaf9f19d711048df477ed5061e91","amp;dn":"Bad+Little+Angel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571a911b93dfaaf9f19d711048df477ed5061e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,26,145,27,147,223,170,249,241,157,113,16,72,223,71,126,213,6,30,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
