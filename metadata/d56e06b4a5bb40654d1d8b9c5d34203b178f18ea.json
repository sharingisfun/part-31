Higgins is the author of more than sixty novels. Most have been thrillers of various types and, since his breakthrough novel The Eagle Has Landed in 1975, nearly all have been bestsellers. The Eagle Has Landed sold tens of millions of copies worldwide\n\nFrom Recorded Books:\nPacked with honor, bravery, and intrigue, Jack HigginsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ fast-moving thrillers consistently burst onto best-seller lists on both sides of the Atlantic. In this multi-layered story of revenge and suspense, a brutal death in Brooklyn sends shocking repercussions around the world. When journalist Katherine Johnson learns too much about crime boss Jack Fox, he silences her once and for all. But he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reckon with her ex-husband Blake Johnson, a former FBI agent with formidable British connections. Intent on hitting Fox where it hurts most, Blake unleashes his own deadly brand of vengeance - destroying FoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s illegal holdings from New York to the Middle East. A master storyteller, Jack Higgins captivates fans with his pulse-pounding action and surprises around every corner. Many of his books have been made into popular movies. Frank Muller provides the perfect voice for the determined Blake and his powerful enemies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56e06b4a5bb40654d1d8b9c5d34203b178f18ea","amp;dn":"DAY+OF+RECKONING+-+Jack+Higgins.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56e06b4a5bb40654d1d8b9c5d34203b178f18ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,110,6,180,165,187,64,101,77,29,139,156,93,52,32,59,23,143,24,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
