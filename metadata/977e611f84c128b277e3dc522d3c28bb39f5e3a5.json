This is NOT sourced from a video.\n\n\n&quot;A Hyper Circle&quot; is sourced from the boot, but the NIN portion came without lineage info and has a slightly worse sound quality.  Tracks 1-10 from &quot;Closer to Trent&quot; and tracks 11-31 from &quot;A Hyper Cirlce&quot;.\n\nApart from the recording starting during first verse of Terrible Lie, there is only one small gap between the two recordings.  Because &quot;Closer to Trent&quot; skips Eraser and &quot;A Hyper Circle&quot; starts at the begining of Eraser, the crowd cheering after Down In It is cut.  \n\n99.71% CDDA confirmed lossless by Audiochecker_beta_2.0.0.457\n\nThanks to the original taper.\n\n\nassembled and uploaded to Dimeadozen by gladcarrot on February 20th 2009\n\nMany thanks to gladcarrot for having uploaded this recording to Dime. I renamed tracks and added tags (in addition to editing the info file), so this torrent hasn't the same info hash as the one previously shared. All I have to say is that this is an Excellent (IMO) Audience Recording, even if not as good as some others like Camden, with the NIN portion sounding slightly worse (as said by gladcarrot).\n\nUploaded to Mind-Warp PaVilion by TheManWhoSoldTheWorld on January 1st, 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977e611f84c128b277e3dc522d3c28bb39f5e3a5","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+and+David+Bowie+-+Hartford+%5C%2795+%28FLAC%29+%5Btntvil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977e611f84c128b277e3dc522d3c28bb39f5e3a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,126,97,31,132,193,40,178,119,227,220,82,45,60,40,187,57,245,227,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
