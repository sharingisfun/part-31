Now, after four years in the making, we wander through the bushy corridors of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ask For TigersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like one wanders in a vintage old video game, through the empty spaces of museums, along the burning borders of a swimming-pool on a hot summer day, through the revisitation of songs that were written such a long, long time ago. We come across a rural superhero, a pair of choppers, an anti-New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day organisation, a satanist racoon. We rumble in krautrock and noise territory, then stumble over random electronic textures, over existential futile questionings, over a cover of an old Donovan song. It is definitely a songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record, also. It is full of stupid melodies to get all emotional. Full of guitars to knock your head off. Full of noise for exultation. It is also definitely a researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record, tinted with an urge to create new forms, new means, to fulfill envies, methods of work. There are, eventually, stories to be heard, whether in the form of cryptic lyrics or barenaked melodies. Simple as hell, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ask For TigerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is, plain and all, a collection of sung songs. It is, plain and all, a summary of StÃƒÂ©phaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work over the last years, and that it roars hard. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ask for TigerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, just ask.\n\nArtist : Domotic\nAlbum : Ask For Tiger\nLabel : Active Suspension Ã¢â‚¬Å½- ACD12\nTotal Time : 47min.:05sec.\nYear : 2005\nGenre : Electronic; Experimental, Ambient\nBitrate : 192 kbps CBR\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
