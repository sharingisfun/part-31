After leaving Epic Records in 2003, Aiko took a hiatus from her music career and returned in 2011, with the release of her debut mixtape Sailing Soul(s). After raising her profile with the mixtape, Aiko met with record producer No I.D., and subsequently secured a recording contract with his newly found record label imprint, Artium. Following her record deal, Aiko immediately began working on the album; during the recording process, Aiko released her debut EP Sail Out (2013), to bridge the gap between her mixtape and the album.\n\n&quot;Souled Out&quot; is an PBR&amp;B album with a diverse musical style that incorporates psychedelic music, R&amp;B and hip hop and elements of electronica. Its songs feature electronic guitar sounds, synths, drums and atmospheric noises. A concept album, &quot;Souled Out&quot; features the evolution of a womans heartbreak before becoming enlightened, the album features lyrics that revolve around relationships, life lessons, philosophies and truths. Aiko wrote the album and contracted four key producers to help create a cohesive sound.\n\n==========================================================================\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
