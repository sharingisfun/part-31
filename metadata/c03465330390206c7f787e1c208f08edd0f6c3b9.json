Illogicist Plays Technical Metal with slight Death Overtones such as Guttural Vocals and momentary blast-beats, it sounds incredibly similar to label-mates Alarum but with a more hostile approach, and it has the great influence of bands like Atheist and Cynic but with less Death Metal in the formula, so when we do regular maths we&amp;#039;ll get a balanced outfit that plays as technical as a drilling machine dry-walling an avant-garde building.\n\nThe artwork could have been better though, while the music gives us one hell of a listen, the layout is actually quite simple, most of you won&amp;#039;t even care about this but it&amp;#039;s something that catches the eye instantly while reading the lyrics and &quot;thank you&amp;#039;s&quot;; still the production is amazing, the music sounds clear and freakingly powerful, exactly what we need to fully appreciate an incredibly complex technical record.\n\nMusic-wise the followers of the genre will be pleased, the overall tone is somehow mild and smooth but it manages to keep things aggressive when the context needs it, so it&amp;#039;s not about how Deathy this band can get, it&amp;#039;s the crucial execution and the multi-faceted songwriting what kills our ears this time. Then people who can&amp;#039;t stand Necrophagist, Man Must Die or Spawn Of Possession because they&amp;#039;re &quot;too damn loud&quot; will be able to hear a less violent CD with structures alike with a big smile on their face.\n\nAn album specially made for fans of Sleep Terror, Martyr, Alarum and classic monsters like Cynic and Atheist.\n\nBest Tracks: &quot;Brain Collapse&quot;, &quot;The Absolute Or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Soundless Pain&quot;\n\nPerformance:   \t9\nSongwriting: \t8\nOriginality: \t7\nProduction: \t8\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/cf9ee1d3-f250-4ac3-bc0b-ee08d0d9a566.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/cf9ee1d3-f250-4ac3-bc0b-ee08d0d9a566.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=4537&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=4537&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEAC Lame 3.97 v0 VBR with log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03465330390206c7f787e1c208f08edd0f6c3b9","amp;dn":"Illogicist+%282007%29+-+The+Insight+Eye+%28V0%29+%2AItalian+Tech.+Death+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03465330390206c7f787e1c208f08edd0f6c3b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,52,101,51,3,144,32,108,127,120,126,28,32,143,8,237,208,246,195,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
