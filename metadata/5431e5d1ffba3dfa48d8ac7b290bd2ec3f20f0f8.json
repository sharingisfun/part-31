The Original Tanoshi Moomin Ikka background music. Includes all 3 CD:s, what are relased only in Japan in 1990 and 1992. Moomin Selection songs are some in english, because i don't know their Japanese names. I also cutted those songs, what aren't really in the series (Theres missing the second theme of Japanese version). The main composer is Sumio Shiratori, the singer is Emiko Shiratori. The 2 first albums have some  maybe annoying Japanese &quot;dramatizing&quot;.\n\n\nYou can find more Moomin music from FIBURAZ's YouTube channel. They are arrangements of the original music, but amazingly great made.\n\nPLEASE SEED!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5431e5d1ffba3dfa48d8ac7b290bd2ec3f20f0f8","amp;dn":"Sumio+Shiratori+-+Original+Tanoshii+Moomin+Ikka+Music+%5BFIX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5431e5d1ffba3dfa48d8ac7b290bd2ec3f20f0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,49,229,209,255,186,61,250,72,216,172,123,41,11,210,236,63,32,240,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
