And The M.G.'s - All Along The Watchtower (2nafish)\n\n\n\n&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; is a song written and recorded by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It initially appeared on his album John Wesley Harding. It has been covered by other artists in different genres, most notably by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. There exists much speculation as to what the song is actually about.\n\nNeil Young performed a version live, and was joined onstage by The Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde. This version later appeared on Young's live album Road Rock Vol. 1: Friends &amp; Relatives. He has also played this song with Booker T. and the M.G.'s at the Dylan 30th Anniversary Celebration (aka &quot;Bobfest&quot;) at Madison Square Garden. The subsequent recording of the Dylan tribute was issued in 1993.\n\nNeil Percival Young, OC, OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician, filmmaker and activist. Young began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills, and later joined Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash as a fourth member in 1969. He then forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968. His career has spanned 50 years and 33 studio albums, which have seen him explore a wide variety of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as &quot;one of rock and rollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest songwriters and performers&quot;. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and secondly as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997. Young has been nominated for multiple Grammy Awards and has won once.\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto/tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano, harpsichord and harmonica, his clawhammer acoustic guitar and often idiosyncratic electric guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a sometimes ragged, sometimes melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: either acoustic folk and country rock, or amplified hard rock in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse. Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the &quot;Godfather of Grunge&quot;.\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past  (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20ebdbcb41494f52680321298418d2fa11305f2","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+with+Booker+T.+%26+M.G.%5C%27s-All+Along+The+Watchtower","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20ebdbcb41494f52680321298418d2fa11305f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,14,189,188,180,20,148,245,38,128,50,18,152,65,141,47,161,19,5,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
