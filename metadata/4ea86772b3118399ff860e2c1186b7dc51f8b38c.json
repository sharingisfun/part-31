The film is set in\nan alternative 1939 and follows the adventures of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), a\nnewspaper reporter for The Chronicle, and H. Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Sullivan (Jude Law), known\nas &quot;Sky Captain&quot;, as they track down the mysterious &quot;Dr. Totenkopf&quot;.\n\nConran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer with a bluescreen set up\nin his living room and using a Macintosh IIci personal computer. He was able to get\nproducer Jon Avnet to see it, who was so impressed that he spent two years working with\nthe aspiring filmmaker on his screenplay. None of the major studios were interested in\nfinancing such an unusual film with a first-time director. Avnet convinced Aurelio De\nLaurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal...\n\n\n[img]http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/14/snapshot1kw.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/9260/snapshot2o.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/5863/snapshot3c.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/5232/snapshot4o.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\nID                               : 1\nDuration                         : 1h 46mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 3356 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 46mn\nBit rate                         : 2830 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.128\n\nAudio\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nLanguage                         : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea86772b3118399ff860e2c1186b7dc51f8b38c","amp;dn":"Sky+Captain+World+of+Tomorrow+BDrip+720p+%5BM2ts+-+Ac3Dolby%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea86772b3118399ff860e2c1186b7dc51f8b38c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,168,103,114,179,17,131,153,255,134,14,44,17,134,183,220,81,248,179,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
