Heavy radio, video and retail attention led to the single's #39 debut on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, during the week of May 6, 1989. The single steadily climbed to the top, reaching the #1 spot the week of June 24, 1989. &quot;Satisfied&quot; was the first of five Top 20 singles from Marx's second studio album, which kept the artist on the singles chart through the Summer of 1990.\n\nMarx's management felt that he needed one more uptempo song for the Repeat Offender album. Marx wrote three more songs and played each of them for his management. Marx and his management all felt that &quot;Satisfied&quot; is the song he needed to kick things off for the album.\n\nRepeat Offender is the second studio album by singer/songwriter Richard Marx. Released in mid-1989, it replaced Prince's Batman soundtrack at #1 on Billboard's album chart. The album went on to sell over four million copies in the United States alone (several times that worldwide) due to three singles in the Billboard Top Five including two #1 hits: &quot;Satisfied&quot; and the Platinum-selling &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;.\n\nAfter touring for 14 months on his first album, Marx returned to the studio with a number of songs that had been written while on the road. The album was recorded with well-known L.A.-area studio musicians and would go on to become even more successful than his debut record.\n\nRichard Noel Marx (born September 16, 1963 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American adult contemporary and pop/rock singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He had a string of hit singles in the late 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;, &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;, &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, and &quot;Hazard&quot;. Although most of his major hit songs were slow ballads, many of his songs had a classic rock style, such as &quot;Don't Mean Nothing,&quot; &quot;Should've Known Better,&quot; &quot;Satisfied,&quot; and &quot;Too Late To Say Goodbye&quot;. Marx placed himself in the record books by being the first solo artist to have his first seven singles hit the Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4). His record sales worldwide exceed 30 million.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f5ef5bc87dece8db7e0dd02811ce60e11eaf6e","amp;dn":"Richard+Marx+-+Satisfied++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f5ef5bc87dece8db7e0dd02811ce60e11eaf6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,245,239,91,200,125,236,232,219,126,13,208,40,17,206,96,225,30,175,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
