Made to be as small as possible yet maintain great 720p video.\r\n\r\nThis is the entire season one, replacing my earlier torrents of each episode. Seasons 2 and 3 are also available.\r\n\r\nI used x265 in a multipass &quot;slow&quot; 10 bit HEVC encode at an average bitrate of 600kbps. The audio is a simple compact stereo 128kbps AAC.\r\n\r\nFinally, the English subtitles are included.\r\n\r\nI think x265 has done a pretty good job with the low bandwidth I granted it. Please share, comment, flame or enjoy.\r\n\r\nVideo Codec h265 10 Bit LE\r\nResolution1280 x 720\r\nMode Progressive\r\nAspect Ratio 16:9\r\nFramerate 23.976\r\nAverage Bitrate 600kbps\r\nMax Bitrate 2000kbps\r\nPixel Format 4:2:0\r\n\r\nAudio AAC\r\nChannels 2\r\nBitrate 128kbps\r\n\r\nSubtitles SRT English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b52655366532e47d6efc7d1726695e0e0a673fb","amp;dn":"Borgia+S01+Genuine+Blu-ray+Rip+720p+HEVC+10-Bit+EN+SRT+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b52655366532e47d6efc7d1726695e0e0a673fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,82,101,83,102,83,46,71,214,239,199,209,114,102,149,224,224,166,115,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
