These are available in other torrents, but alongside a lot of fringe conspiracy theory paraphernalia. You may ask what 'makes these any better?'\n\nTheir sources:\n\nJim Garrison, the District Attorney of New Orleans at the time of the assassination, remains the only prosecutor to try a JFK assassination conspirator on criminal charges. His effort was dramatized in Oliver Stone's JFK. \n\nMark Lane unsuccessfully petitioned Congress to represent the Oswald estate during the Warren Commission, and was an early, frequent and vocal critic of the commission's findings. Rush to Judgment was the first and ultimate critique of the slipshod Warren Commission.\n\nRobert Groden is a photo technician who did initial work on the Zapruder film for Life Magazine, assisted in the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and testified at the Rockefeller Commission on the CIA.\n\nIf, like most people, you have questions regarding the Warren Commission findings, this is where you should start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1eaf0f79c420b712404ad1ae722b8ddaa45cb91","amp;dn":"JFK+Assassination+-+Lane+%28Rush+to+Judgment%29%2C+Groden+%28Case+for+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1eaf0f79c420b712404ad1ae722b8ddaa45cb91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,234,240,247,156,66,11,113,36,4,173,26,231,34,184,221,170,69,203,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
