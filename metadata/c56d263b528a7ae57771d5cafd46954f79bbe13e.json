In the stories of the anthology, Foglio satirizes numerous plot elements of fantasy and science fiction, such as time travel, cloning, robots, deals with the devil, love potions and geasa.\n\nAlthough there are numerous sexual practices portrayed in the series, including &quot;oral sex, anal sex, group sex, masturbation, voyeurism, double penetration, inter-racial (literally), bestiality (although generally with an animal possessing intelligence), mild sado-masochism, homosexuality (female, in every issue; male, just in the last issue), exhibitionism, sex with any number of devices, necrophilia (or sex with a ghost, anyway), prostitution, and every single position and combination imaginable, including some that were only possible in micro-gravity&quot;, Foglio&amp;#039;s general emphasis throughout is on the enjoyment of sexuality as healthy and natural.\n\nThe feedback address is:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;63250d055153535323040e020a0f4d000c0e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56d263b528a7ae57771d5cafd46954f79bbe13e","amp;dn":"Xxxenophile+Volumes+1-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56d263b528a7ae57771d5cafd46954f79bbe13e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,109,38,59,82,138,122,229,119,113,213,202,253,70,149,79,121,187,225,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
