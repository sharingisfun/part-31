Schifftner (CRC, 2002).pdf\n\nISBN: 1-58716-069-2\n\nThe selection of air pollution control apparatus can be a daunting task even for experienced pollution control professionals. The Air Pollution Control Equipment Selection Guide eases the burden by providing extensive information on the best equipment available for any air pollution control problem. Instead of endorsing one technology over another, the author provides general information so that you can decide on the proper technology to use for any given application.\n\nThe book offers ample introductory information including a helpful &quot;Air Pollution 101&quot; chapter that reviews the basics of air pollution control. The text is divided into sections that are organized by the primary technology employed, i.e., Quenching, Cooling, Particulate Removal, Gas Absorption, etc. This structure enables you to jump from section to section and quickly compare technologies. Each section defines the type of gas cleaning device, the basic physical forces used in it, its common sizes, and its most common uses.\n\nMany air pollution control problems are not solved with one type of device, but through using a variety of designs synergistically. To make this task easier, the author includes sections on each of these devices and notes where they are commonly used in concert with other equipment. Wherever possible, the text includes current photographs or drawings of typical equipment within that device type. Written in an easy to read style, Air Pollution Control Equipment Selection Guide serves as a technologically accurate reference that will facilitate the selection of air pollution control equipment for any operation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61befec3d65066782c5233929660f204c4b2e43a","amp;dn":"Air+Pollution+Control+Equipment+Selection+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61befec3d65066782c5233929660f204c4b2e43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,190,254,195,214,80,102,120,44,82,51,146,150,96,242,4,196,178,228,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
