Primarily comprised of acoustic material, including a demo of &quot;The Circle&quot; and a fine, stripped-down version of &quot;The Day We Caught the Train,&quot; the 16 tracks on B-Sides can tend to sound a little samey, but when the group branches out to the neo-prog-rock of the very English &quot;Huckleberry Grove&quot; or to the funky instrumental &quot;Chicken Bones and Stones,&quot; they sound better than ever, and a couple of early songs by the pre-Ocean Colour Scene band the Fanatics are interesting. Still, about half of the songs suggest that OCS may be a little too reverent in their appreciation for late-'60s rock, since they come across as only stylistic exercise, not full songs. And their live cover of &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; featuring Noel Gallagher on guitar and Liam Gallagher on vocals, is an embarassment, simply because Liam's restrained vocals slay Simon Fowler's bellowing. But this is an isolated moment on B-Sides: Seasides &amp; Freerides, since it contains enough first-rate material to make it necessary for dedicated fans.\nAll Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Huckleberry Grove\n[02] The Day We Caught The Train [Acoustic Version]\n[03] Mrs Jones\n[04] Top Of The World\n[05] Here In My Heart\n[06] I Wanna Stay Alive With You\n[07] Robin Hood\n[08] Chelsea Walk\n[09] Outside Of A Circle\n[10] The Clock Struck 15 Hours Ago\n[11] Alibis\n[12] Chicken Bones And Stones\n[13] Cool Cool Water\n[14] Charlie Brown Says\n[15] Day Tripper\n[16] Beautiful Losers\n\nPlay Time - 00h:51m:55s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 134mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
