After some introductory chapters about time-independent and time dependent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), the standard techniques of S-matrix and Green &quot;s functions are reviewed. Next, the newly introduced covariant-evolution-operator method is described, which can be used, like the S-matrix method, for calculations in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Unlike the S-matrix method, this has a structure that is similar to that of MBPT and therefore can serve as basis for a unified theory. Such an approach is developed in the final chapters, and its equivalence to the Bethe-Salpeter equation is demonstrated. Possible applications are discussed and numerical illustrations given.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260eabba7af2bb8a300ce4b8f6fb1017df5f2657","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Relativistic+Many-Body+Theory+A+New+Field-Theoretic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260eabba7af2bb8a300ce4b8f6fb1017df5f2657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,14,171,186,122,242,187,138,48,12,228,184,246,251,16,23,223,95,38,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
