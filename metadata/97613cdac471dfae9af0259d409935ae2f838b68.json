He also has the ability to control the mind of his cat (who incidentally is black). He uses the cat to take vengeance upon his enemies. A photographer who happen to be working for the local constables begins to notice cat scratches on some of the accident victims that are turning up. She pays a visit to Magee (kitty just happens to be present) and conveys her suspicions of the cat's involvement in some of the local deaths. Kitty doesn't like this at all, and it's his turn to control the mind of owner Magee to take it's vengeance out.\n\nLANGUAGE: English\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0080440\n\nVideo Format: Matroska\nVideo Bitrate: 2 145 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nAspect Ratio: 2:35:1\nResolution: 700 x 358\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.357\nAudio Format: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps\n\nNot my rip.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97613cdac471dfae9af0259d409935ae2f838b68","amp;dn":"The+Black+Cat+%281981%29+Lucio+Fulci+DVDRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97613cdac471dfae9af0259d409935ae2f838b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,97,60,218,196,113,223,174,154,240,37,157,64,153,53,174,47,131,139,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
