This new edition covers the fundamental scientific knowledge that all trainee engineers must acquire in order to pass their exams, and has been brought fully in line with the compulsory science and mathematics units in the new engineering course specifications.\r\n\r\nJohn Bird focuses upon engineering examples, enabling students to develop a sound understanding of engineering systems in terms of the basic laws and principles. This book includes over 580 worked examples, 1300 further problems, 425 multiple choice questions (with answers), and contains sections covering the mathematics that students will require within their engineering studies, mechanical applications, electrical applications and engineering systems.\r\n\r\n- Colour layout helps navigation and highlights key learning points, formulae and exercises\r\n- Understanding can be tested with the 580 worked examples, 1300 further problems and 425 multiple choice questions contained within the book\r\n- Focuses on real-world situations and examples in order to maximise relevance to the student reader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d04e77353129d51d85264bd2ea661a561478f400","amp;dn":"Science+for+Engineering%2C+5th+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d04e77353129d51d85264bd2ea661a561478f400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,78,119,53,49,41,213,29,133,38,75,210,234,102,26,86,20,120,244,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
