As secretary of the Walpole Club he's duty-bound to arrange whatever function the \nEvents Committee decides is appropriate to celebrate the Club's 250th birthday. It's just that what they have \ndecided upon seems to William almost wholly inappropriate; worse still he's not sure he knows precisely what form \nsuch a function should take. And if that isn't bad enough, the whole business is supposed to be a deep secret, so \nhe can't even discuss it with his lovely young wife Milly. Milly has her own problems. Is she going off William? \nHis secretiveness is certainly disturbing. And now the Baroque Trio she runs has lost its viola and continuo player\n - Catriona has decamped to Los Angeles with a session guitarist called Trev.\n\nTorn between the demands of the Events Committee, Milly, and an accountant in a diaphanous sari, spied on by a \ntreacherous underporter with a hotline to the tabloids and pressurized by the chairperson of the Golden Horn \nLadies Belly-Dancing Ensemble, Catford, the harrassed William has some appallingly difficult decisions to make.\n\nThe Walpole Orange, astonishingly, was Frank Muir's first novel. As one might expect from Britain's leading humorist, \nit is highly imaginative, wickedly witty and utterly irresistible.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c41e55fe3d08d573ee61019b2c5ae9542475551","amp;dn":"The+Walpole+Orange","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c41e55fe3d08d573ee61019b2c5ae9542475551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,65,229,95,227,208,141,87,62,230,16,25,178,197,174,149,66,71,85,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
