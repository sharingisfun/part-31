It was scheduled to be aired the same night in the United States but was postponed to make way for an address by President Obama. \n\nThe quality is quite watchable, but not as nice as a scene release. The source was non-HD and this is not a digital capture.\n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Human.Target.2010.S02E10.TVRip.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            355,950,592 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             41:51.989\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              1012 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              108 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e08daf95119579540d4466e93a2774d7fca342","amp;dn":"Human+Target+2010+S02E10+TVRip.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e08daf95119579540d4466e93a2774d7fca342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,224,141,175,149,17,149,121,84,13,68,102,233,58,39,116,215,252,163,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
