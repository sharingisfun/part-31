Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n(Kayla/Silverfox and Logan/Wolverine)\n\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 2009 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics' fictional character Wolverine. The fourth installment in the X-Men series, it was released worldwide on May 1, 2009. The film is directed by Gavin Hood and stars Hugh Jackman as the title character, along with Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Will.i.am, Lynn Collins, Taylor Kitsch, Daniel Henney, and Ryan Reynolds. The film acts as a prequel to the X-Men film series, focusing on the violent past of the mutant Wolverine and his relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed. The plot also details Wolverine's early encounters with Major William Stryker, his time with Team X, and the bonding of Wolverine's skeleton with the indestructible metal adamantium during the Weapon X  program.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1845 Canada, young James Howlett sees his father killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from James' hands, and he kills his father's murderer. With his dying breath, Thomas Logan reveals that he, not John Howlett, is James' real father. James flees with Victor Creed, the abused son of their father who is thus James' brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a local village woman, but is stopped after killing a senior officer. Despite his objections to Victor's actions, James defends his brother, and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them, now in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including marksman Agent Zero, swordsman Wade Wilson, teleporter John Wraith, invincible Fred Dukes and electropathic Chris Bradley. They join the team, but the group's questionable actions and disregard for human life cause James to leave.\n\nSix years later, James, now going by the name Logan, lives in Canada with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox. Colonel Stryker locates Logan and warns him that someone is killing members of the team; both Wilson and Bradley are dead. Shortly afterward, Victor murders Kayla and attacks Logan. Stryker offers Logan a way to beat Victor; Logan undergoes an operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Before the procedure, Logan asks for new dog tags inscribed with &quot;Wolverine&quot;, based on a story that Kayla told him. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker orders Logan's memory erased, but Logan overhears and fights his way out. Logan hides at a farm, but the next day Zero tracks him down. Zero attacks Logan, killing the owners of the farm, but later he defeats Zero and continues his revenge.\n\nLogan locates Wraith and Dukes and asks them about the location of Stryker's new laboratory, referred to as &quot;The Island&quot;. They tell him to find Remy LeBeau, who escaped and knows the location of The Island. Logan locates Gambit in New Orleans, and asks for the Island's location, but Gambit suspects Logan was sent to recapture him and attacks. Creed manages to find Logan, and after killing Wraith, he attacks him. When Logan is about to kill Victor, Gambit interrupts, giving Victor the chance to escape. Logan and Gambit fight one last time before Logan convinces him he is not working for Stryker. Gambit takes him to Stryker's facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive and conspired with Stryker in exchange for her sister's safety.\n\nLogan leaves, enraging Victor. When Victor demands the adamantium bonding promised for his service, Stryker refuses on the basis that Victor would not survive the procedure. Victor attempts to kill Kayla when she tries to persuade him Stryker betrayed them both, but Logan hears her screams and returns. Logan defeats and nearly kills Victor, but stops when Kayla reminds him of his humanity. Kayla and Logan free the imprisoned mutants.\n\n\n[ Info sul file ]\n\nNome: Wolverine MUX.avi\nData: 18/01/2011 14:54:40\nDimensione: 1,525,721,088 bytes (1455.041 MB)\n\n[ Info generiche ]\n\nDurata: 01:42:56 (6176.36 s)\nTipo di contenitore: AVI OpenDML\nStreams totali: 3\nTipo stream n. 0: video\nTipo stream n. 1: audio\nTipo stream n. 2: audio\nAudio streams: 2\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.4.13\nINAM: Wolverin Origins\nISBJ: Wolverin Origins\nIART: Colleromito\nICOP: nautilus-bt.org\nJUNK: VirtualDub build 14328/release\n\n[ Giudizi sulla qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ]\n\nRisoluzione: MEDIA (640 x 272)\nLarghezza: multipla di 32 (BENE)\nAltezza: multipla di 16 (BENE)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  DRF medio: ALTA (2.085202)\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  deviazione standard: ALTA (0.715920)\nMedia pesata dev. std.: ALTA (0.558063)\n\n[ Traccia video ]\n\nFourCC: divx/DX50\nRisoluzione: 640 x 272\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nFrames totali: 154409\nBitrate: 1449.729597 kbps\nQf: 0.333118\nMax key int: 250\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 1 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 197,642,240 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Traccia audio n. 2 ]\n\nAudio tag: 0x2000 (AC3)\nBitrate: 256 kbps CBR\nCanali: 5\nFrequenza: 48000 Hz\nStream size: 197,642,240 bytes\nRitardo: 0 ms\n\n[ Info sulla codifica MPEG4 ]\n\nUser data: DivX503b2816p\nPacked bitstream: SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nFrames totali: 154409\nFrames corrotti: 0\n\nI-VOPs: 5171 (  3.349 %)\nP-VOPs: 92962 ( 60.205 %)\nB-VOPs: 56276 ( 36.446 %)\n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 1\n\n[ Analisi DRF ]\n\nDRF medio: 2.085202\nDeviazione standard: 0.715920\nDRF max: 4\n\nDRF=1: 33471 ( 21.677 %)\nDRF=2: 74393 ( 48.179 %)\nDRF=3: 46463 ( 30.091 %)\nDRF=4:    82 (  0.053 %)\nDRF&gt;4:     0 (  0.000 %)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3335e9fd3c1b3bafe7b50d7f681eef2d0bda7c5","amp;dn":"X-Men+Origins+-+Wolverine+%5BDivX+Ac3+5.1+Ita+Eng%5D+nautilus-bt.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3335e9fd3c1b3bafe7b50d7f681eef2d0bda7c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,51,94,159,211,193,179,186,254,123,80,215,246,129,238,242,208,189,167,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
