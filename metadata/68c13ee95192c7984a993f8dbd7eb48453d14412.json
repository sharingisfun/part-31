The tracks &quot;Into Another&quot;, &quot;My Enemy&quot; and &quot;Breakin' Down&quot; were remixed for this album with more tender, slightly cleaner mixes, presumably so they fit more suitingly with the other tracks. It also included two unreleased tracks, one from the 1988 Skid Row sessions, and one from the 1990-91 Slave To The Grind sessions.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Youth Gone Wild&quot;   \t \t3:21\n2. \t&quot;18 and Life&quot;   \t \t3:49\n3. \t&quot;Piece of Me&quot;   \t\t2:48\n4. \t&quot;I Remember You&quot;         \t5:14\n5. \t&quot;The Threat&quot;             \t3:48\n6. \t&quot;Psycho Love&quot;   \t \t3:58\n7. \t&quot;Monkey Business&quot;   \t \t4:19\n8. \t&quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot;   \t \t5:21\n9. \t&quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;    \t3:31\n10. \t&quot;Into Another&quot; (Remix)  \t3:59\n11. \t&quot;Frozen&quot; (Demo 1994) \t \t5:32\n12. \t&quot;My Enemy&quot; (Remix) \t \t3:32\n13. \t&quot;Breakin' Down&quot; (Remix)  \t4:28\n\n14. \t&quot;Beat Yourself Blind&quot; (Live from The Astoria,London, England 1995) 5:20\n15. \t&quot;Forever&quot; (Previously unreleased 1988) \t                           4:04\n16. \t&quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; (Previously unreleased demo 1991) \t           3:26\n\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c13ee95192c7984a993f8dbd7eb48453d14412","amp;dn":"Skid+Row+-+Forty+Seasons+-+Best+of+%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c13ee95192c7984a993f8dbd7eb48453d14412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,193,62,233,81,146,199,152,74,153,63,141,189,126,180,132,83,209,68,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
