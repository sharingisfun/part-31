It was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan. The film is inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1928 nonfiction book The Gangs of New York. It was distributed by Miramax Films and was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nThe film begins in 1846 and quickly jumps to the early 1860s. The two principal issues of the era in New York were Irish immigration to the city and the Federal government's execution of the Civil War. The story follows Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) in his roles as crime boss and political kingmaker under the helm of Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent). The film culminates in a confrontation between Cutting and his mob with the protagonist Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his immigrant allies, which coincides with the New York Draft Riots of 1863.\n\nPLEASE...SEED...AND...ENJOY...THANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33590e6bb16ec90b3c446a1b1a30f81ca7eae1a7","amp;dn":"Gangs.Of.New.York...DVDrip%28vice%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33590e6bb16ec90b3c446a1b1a30f81ca7eae1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,89,14,107,177,110,201,11,60,68,106,27,26,48,248,28,167,234,225,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
