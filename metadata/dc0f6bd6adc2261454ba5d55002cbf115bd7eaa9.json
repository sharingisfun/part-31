Until recently, most of these profits were only available to big tourism corporations. However, the internet and social networking tools have opened the doors for average individuals to share enormously from this huge tourism money.\n\nThe best option for any individual to join in the fun and begin earning money from the international tourism industry is to affiliate himself with an already existing corporate tourism brand. It is cheaper, easier and less time consuming than trying to create a new brand alone.\nThe best corporate tourism brand existing today is BONVOYAGE1000, an American-based Travel and Tourism Company with membership opened to individuals from all over the world. Membership fee is $350 for a lifetime membership. There are no annual renewal fees of any sort.\n\nYour success in earning commissions from Bonvoyage1000 will depend on the level of commitment you have, how knowledgeable you are about the BV1000 packages and members compensation plan as well as the amount of team support you can get.\n\nThis little book is not meant to make you a tourism expert; rather, it is meant to show you what potentials you have as an independent tourism services provider. \n\nThe book gives you introductory information on:\n\n1. How to enter the tourism industry as an individual investor.\n\n2. How to build your customer list.\n\n3. How to offer selected tourism services to your customers.\n\n4. How to easily move money from one part of the world to another, quickly and efficiently.\n\n5. How to guarantee a constant income from the tourism industry.\n\nBut all the information contained in this book is only the beginning, your decision to try your hands on suggested steps will be the ultimate key to your success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0f6bd6adc2261454ba5d55002cbf115bd7eaa9","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Profits+in+the+International+Tourism+Industry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0f6bd6adc2261454ba5d55002cbf115bd7eaa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,15,107,214,173,194,38,20,84,186,93,85,0,44,191,17,91,215,234,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
