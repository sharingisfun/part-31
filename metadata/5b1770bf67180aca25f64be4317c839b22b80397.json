FOL 2009 also marked a clear and positive turning point in the ability for Team Indigo (and all who choose to come on this Journey on NET Earth) to engage more fully their own personal lines of Kristic communication and transformative healing. The orientation lecture was no less action-packed than any other, covering subjects like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Budd SelfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and its place in relation to the Elum- Eiradhona Spirit Body, the Orb people, the Ah-RAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-yas (introduced in St Kitts) and their ability to increase and maintain our Light QuotientÃ‚Â¸ the Uni-genetic Underlay (UGU) and the Inner Sun of Aquarie. The workshop then kicked off with a run through of a selection of the Sliders-1 and -2 techniques including Induction of the AllurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢E-ah Rashatan Code, Creating the TEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a-Wha Vision Seed, Activating the Organic Pentagonal Circulation and Activating the Grail Window Parts A-E. Then after a brief update on the Treaty of Al-BhenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-Yhan and the Krist Fall Host, Team Indigo called in the first of the AquaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Solar Luna Transmissions (AquaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-ah de So-LaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-RA LUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢na Ah-VE-yas Elemental Living Light Transmissions), Median Earth pulses that travel at nano-speed and which will continue to build between now and 2230. After this, lecture topics included the Red/White and Green electorate maps in North America, the Load-Out Charts, the Milky Way Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gates, the artificial Procyak Grid holding the Bloom of Doom at its centre, the role of Methane Deposits, Sink Holes and the twisted NET Earth Rod in fulfillment of the Omega Kill Code, the interconnectedness of NET Earth, Median Earth, AshalA, ShaLa and Urtha, and the second expansion of the Shield of Solomon/AdorA, a global network of Kristic energetic structures that can override the Omega Kill Code activations. The final lecture consisted of a wonderfully detailed update on the Chronology of the Cosmic Drama, where the number of Kristic Mission Upgrades far outnumbered the number of Drama Escalations (Drama Escalation # 28 to 31 and Mission Upgrade # 27 to 38 are covered in the supplement).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1770bf67180aca25f64be4317c839b22b80397","amp;dn":"Festival+of+Light+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1770bf67180aca25f64be4317c839b22b80397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,23,112,191,103,24,10,202,37,246,75,228,49,124,131,155,34,184,3,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
