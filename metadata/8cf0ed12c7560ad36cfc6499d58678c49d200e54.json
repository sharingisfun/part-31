According to Byrne, the song was written about a girl he knew who used to take LSD in a field next to a Yoo-hoo beverage factory in Baltimore, Maryland. It reached number 54 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 17 on the British singles chart.\n\n&quot;And She Was&quot; was featured in the 1989 film Look Who&amp;#039;s Talking during a montage of the mother-to-be Molly preparing for her child&amp;#039;s arrival. \nIn the 2005 movie Bewitched, the song plays as Isabel (Samantha) transforms her world from magic to normal in her quest to be a regular person instead of a witch. \n\n\n\n\nMy Videos: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf0ed12c7560ad36cfc6499d58678c49d200e54","amp;dn":"Talking+Heads+-+And+She+Was","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf0ed12c7560ad36cfc6499d58678c49d200e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,240,237,18,199,86,10,211,108,252,100,153,213,134,120,196,157,32,14,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
