SUNNY, the proud proprietor, who needs an ingenious plan - and fast - to keep her cafe and customers safe. YAZMINA, a young pregnant woman stolen from her remote village and now abandoned on Kabul's violent streets. CANDACE, a wealthy American who has finally left her husband for her Afghan lover, the enigmatic Wakil. ISABEL, a determined journalist with a secret that might keep her from the biggest story of her life. And HALAJAN, the sixty-year-old den mother, whose long-hidden love affair breaks all the rules. As these five women discover there's more to one another than meets the eye, they form a unique bond that will for ever change their lives and the lives of many others. The Little Coffee Shop of Kabul is the heart-warming and life-affirming fiction debut from the author of the bestselling memoir The Kabul Beauty School.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fd9fef3c5c5d8d286a8cf447e5cf4987a8c4647","amp;dn":"The+Little+Coffee+Shop+of+Kabul+-+Deborah+Rodriguez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fd9fef3c5c5d8d286a8cf447e5cf4987a8c4647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,217,254,243,197,197,216,210,134,168,207,68,126,92,244,152,122,140,70,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
