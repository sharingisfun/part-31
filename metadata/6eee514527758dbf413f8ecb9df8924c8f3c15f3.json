But long before al Qaeda the roots of the threat to America from the Middle East grew in an organization called the Muslim Brotherhood. Journey to Cairo Egypt where the Brotherhood was born in the late 1920s. Learn how Brotherhood members passed radical ideologies to legions of followers including Ayman Zawahiri who would become Osama bin Laden's right-hand man. Today some experts say the Brotherhood could be a powerful ally in fighting the war on terror while others believe that its dark history makes this movement one that can never be trusted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eee514527758dbf413f8ecb9df8924c8f3c15f3","amp;dn":"Brotherhood+of+Terror+-+History+Channel+%282005%29+%5BIslam%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eee514527758dbf413f8ecb9df8924c8f3c15f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,238,81,69,39,117,141,191,65,63,142,203,157,248,146,76,143,60,21,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
