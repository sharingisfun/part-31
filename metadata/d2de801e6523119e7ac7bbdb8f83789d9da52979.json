Left to care for her emotionally disturbed younger sister, her world begins to unravel. She finds an outlet in writing poetry and support from her English teacher, Mr. Auster (Straithairn). But what started out as a mentoring relationship begins to get a bit more complex.\n\nThis was encoded by someone named Maarten Vervoort so I take no credit for it. But decided to upload it to PirateBay to access easily. I loved this movie. Don&amp;#039;t know why.
