Domeng is involved in networking or multi-level marketing business and plans to encourage his estranged daughter Luna to join in this unscrupulous business. Luna is abandoned by her husband and son so she asks help from her mother Aling Tess. Aling Tess is a land lady who lives alone and fancies a young male boarder named Kulas. Kulas is a grocery store employee who aspires to become a store manager to impress Julie. Julie is a laundry shop attendant who is obsessed with a male costumer named Brian. Brian is a nurse in a local hospital who wants to work abroad so he persuades his girlfriend Sally to provide for his &quot;fixer&quot; fees. An accounting graduate who failed to pass the board exam for two consecutive years, Sally enters Domeng's networking business in the hopes of proving her worth. When she found out that networking is a scam Sally plans to take revenge on Domeng. The film illustrates the interconnectedness of our lives, a cycle of random events in which the decisions we make are as important as the choices we didn't take.\n\n\nMOVIE POSTER: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.amreidizon.multiply.com/image/10/photos/13/orig/1/hulingposter1sm.jpg?et=Sxczgs%2C%2C6gPYt5rWr8OdJQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.amreidizon.multiply.com/image/10/photos/13/orig/1/hulingposter1sm.jpg?et=Sxczgs%2C%2C6gPYt5rWr8OdJQ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/432080_129033197240060_907722256_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/432080_129033197240060_907722256_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/386803_129033230573390_325296203_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/386803_129033230573390_325296203_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/599846_129033253906721_1310828412_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/599846_129033253906721_1310828412_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/217979_129033367240043_188167197_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/217979_129033367240043_188167197_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/530073_129033533906693_926487967_n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/530073_129033533906693_926487967_n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\npls. seed after U dwnload.., enjoy...\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e917557f79473a51dde7a3684d40c9d6bfdd979","amp;dn":"Ang+huling+araw+ng+Linggo_PINOY+INDIE+FILM_2006%28DVDRip%29_TOPSIDER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e917557f79473a51dde7a3684d40c9d6bfdd979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,145,117,87,247,148,115,165,29,222,122,54,132,212,12,157,107,253,217,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
