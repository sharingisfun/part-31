Following in the bloody footsteps of super-fiends such as Fantomas, Fu Manchu, or Professor Moriarty, Super-Enigmatix is ruthless, cunning, and thoroughly evil. His only goal is to spread fear and cause chaos Ã¢â‚¬â€ but does he want to destroy civilization, or save it? Not even his loyal army of female commandos can guess his real motives, or his true identity. The fast-moving &quot;picture story&quot; is told with sly humor and all the mayhem is depicted in Sala's trademark colorful watercolor washes and sharp, detailed line-work. Also included in this collection are three shorter stories, appearing in print for the first time, from Richard Sala's archive of strange and offbeat tales!\n\nRichard Sala's books are &quot;deliriously entertaining&quot; (Rue Morgue Magazine), &quot;cinematic and cheerfully over-the-top&quot; (The New York Times Book Review), containing &quot;brilliantly atmospheric art, full of shadows and spikes.&quot; (Booklist)\n\n&quot;To read a Richard Sala comic is an experience both jarring and fun. Good for a rainy day or a stormy night.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;Richard Sala is an artist, a superb craftsman and a very funny man.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gahan Wilson\n\n&quot;Richard Sala is one of the best artists to have worked in comics the last three decades and one of the most underrated cartoonists generally.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tom Spurgeon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1db980aa035c8acc752905cb928cbaa2687ea6b","amp;dn":"Richard+Sala+-+In+A+Glass+Grotesquely+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1db980aa035c8acc752905cb928cbaa2687ea6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,219,152,10,160,53,200,172,199,82,144,92,185,40,203,170,38,135,234,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
