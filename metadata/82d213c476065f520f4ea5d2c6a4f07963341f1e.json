The following press release was also issued about the album:\r\n\r\n&quot;At 47 minutes, Against The Plagues' 'Purified Through Devastation' is just long enough to satisfy, although it still leaves you wanting more. The sound is massive; the riffs are unbelievably chunky and the drumming is in your face and devastatingly heavy. Mixing speed with slower tempos works successfully throughout. This is one excellent slab of blackened death metal that can be considered yet another of this year's elite Extreme Metal releases. A prime example of frightening savagery, amazing musical execution, and excellent songwriting. This one is guaranteed to make year-end top 10 lists.&quot;\r\nThats what it said.
