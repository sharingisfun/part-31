Bruce Springsteen kicks the proceedings off with &quot;My City Of Ruins,&quot; a previously unreleased slice of woe and hope with a gospel-flavored coda. From here, the raw emotion reverberating from these then recent events comes relentlessly flowing out of the speakers, whether its U2's rallying &quot;Walk On,&quot; Tom Petty's defiant &quot;I Won't Back Down,&quot; or Paul Simon's emotional &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters.&quot;\n\nOther goosebump-inducing moments include Alicia Keys' inspiring rendition of Donny Hathaway's &quot;Someday We'll All Be Free,&quot; Neil Young delivering a ragged and heartfelt version of John Lennon's &quot;Imagine,&quot; and Stevie Wonder joining forces with Take 6 to take us to church with &quot;Love's In Need Of Love Today.&quot; Willie Nelson spearheads the finale with an all-star sing-along on a uniquely phrased version of &quot;America The Beautiful&quot; that would do old buddy Ray Charles proud. Most importantly, proceeds from this album go to the September 11th Telethon Fund, administered by the United Way.\n\nLive Recording","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73979723059adab09cb014e77d759caf12d6cf13","amp;dn":"American+Tribute+To+Heroes+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73979723059adab09cb014e77d759caf12d6cf13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,151,151,35,5,154,218,176,156,176,20,231,125,117,156,175,18,214,207,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
