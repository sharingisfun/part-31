I'm Casey Kasem.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener wants to know what the record is for the most &quot;remake-songs&quot; in the top 40 in a single week. Casey says beginning July 26th of 1981 there were seven remakes each week for three weeks. He says that record was set just a few months ago but in his February 20th, 1988 broadcast he says there were 8 remakes on the November 7th, 1970!\n\nAs a temporary duo, Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb have two hits in this countdown, &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;What Kind Of Fool&quot; (at numbers 35 and 26).\n\nCasey pays tribute to the man who popularized rock 'n' roll, Bill Haley (July 6, 1925 to February 9, 1981) who had five top 20 hits before his big smash; &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; ever hit the chart.\n\nCasey answers this question: &quot;Since Elvis was more successful on the soul chart than any other white act, what was the most successful group or duo on the soul chart?&quot; Casey says it is a six-man band from Scotland.\n\nThe band Blondie moves their hit &quot;Rapture&quot; from number 32 last week to number 19 this week, Delbert McClinton (who taught John Lennon to play harmonica), is in the countdown with his first chart single, &quot;Giving It Up For Your Love&quot; (at number 8), and REO Speedwagon has their first chart hit, &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; (at number 6).\n\nLW#1: Celebration - Kool &amp; The Gang\n40:    Killin' Time - Fred Knoblok and Susan Anton\n39:    Don't Stand So Close To Me - The Police\n38:    Precious To Me - Phil Seymour        \n37:    Back In Black - AC/DC     \n36:    Riders In The Sky - The Outlaws     \n35:    Guilty - Barbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb    \n34:    Love On The Rocks - Neil Diamond\n33:    Fade Away - Bruce Springsteen\nLDD: Baby I'm A Want You - Bread\n32:    Seven Bridges Road - The Eagles\nARCHIVES: Chapel Of Love - The Dixie Cups\n31:    Ah!
