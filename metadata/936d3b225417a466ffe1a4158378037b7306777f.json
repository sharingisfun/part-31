He first appears in World War Hulk #5 (November 2007), and was created by Greg Pak and John Romita, Jr..\nSkaar is the progeny of a gamma powered Mutate and one of the Oldstrong Shadow People. As seen in the first issue, the blast that killed Caiera turned her into dust in the Hulk's arms. After her death a cocoon containing Skaar fell into the lake of fire. After a period of time, Skaar emerged from the cocoon, appearing to be the age equivalent of a human preteen. A year later and he appears to have grown into a teenager. He quickly grows into what seems to be an adult after he is attacked by the Bone Axeman's Dragon's flame, which at first looks like an example of his old power. Skaar defeats the Bone Axemen and his dragon with only a sword and his bare hands. Skaar, after having a confrontation with the princess, is shown to be able to speak intelligent sentences when the group is going to be attacked by Wildebots.\n\nIMP: IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be uploading the  repacked torrents every month containing the new issue of Skaar, but I wont be able to seed more than a few hours for the month of March due to the onset of my much dreaded exams. So if you dont see any seeds then wait for 2-3 hours i'll be on and seeding and i'll see you next month.\n\nP.S.: if you are wondering on how to open the files or how to view them , either download and unzip them using 7zip or you can use CDisplay, whose setup has been included in this torrentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..have fun\nCheers\n--Baron\n\nP.P.S : just for your info. this is a clean torrent and has been scanned by AVG Internet security 2008 about 5 times and has passed all tests.............:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936d3b225417a466ffe1a4158378037b7306777f","amp;dn":"Skaar+-+Son+Of+Hulk+%231+to+%238","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936d3b225417a466ffe1a4158378037b7306777f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,109,59,34,84,23,164,102,255,225,164,21,131,120,3,123,115,6,119,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
