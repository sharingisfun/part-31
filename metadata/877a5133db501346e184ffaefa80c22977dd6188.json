It is timebombed.\nYou can get newer builds as they're released by logging into\na MSA Insider Account, but activation should be handled\nautomatically.\n\nThe only modification I've made to each index is to install\nthe default activation keys with /set-productkey dism cmd\nI've added an ei.cfg so you won't need to enter key on boot\ninstalls. Upgrades aren't blocked with ei.cfg like win8.x so\nthere's no need to delete it. Upgrades will not give you a\nchoice for which index you want to install. You have to\nuse boot setup for that.\n\nkeys originally obtained from WZT from previous 10147 build\nesd converter script/prog credits: qad, abbodi1406, murphy78\nwimlib portion done by the wimlib guys.\nenjoy,\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877a5133db501346e184ffaefa80c22977dd6188","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Insider+Preview+build+10162+en-US+4-1+x86+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877a5133db501346e184ffaefa80c22977dd6188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,122,81,51,219,80,19,70,225,132,255,174,250,128,194,41,119,221,97,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
