With a different approach, this series reveals the underlying processes for kids, explaining each regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution and illustrating the different forces of nature that have changed the continent over time. The lush forests of the Pacific Northwest, the dry and arid deserts of the Southwest, and even the volcanoes and rainforests of Hawaii are all explored in detail as the chapters chronicle the effects of plate tectonics; landforms such as mountains, plateaus, and canyons; and the elements of climates and ecosystems. A plethora of hands-on projects ensure the learning process is both engaging and entertaining, including making a swamp cooler, creating a rift zone, building a seismograph, constructing basalt columns and water wheels to harness the power of a river, fashioning moving tectonic plates, and even mimicking natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s process of carving an arch.\n\nAbout The Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1317300523p5/1405920.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1317300523p5/1405920.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nCynthia Light Brown earned her BA in geology from Williams College, and a masters in earth and planetary science from the University of New Mexico.
