Newbies will appreciate the easy to understand language; and the techies will appreciate the thoroughness. With a Jan 2000 release date, the technology within is as current as of about late summer 1999. I appreciated that she gave each component it's own chapter. There is an excellent section on home networking as well. The book is mostly on Pentium class computers but she does give an honorable mention to the x86's. Overall, this is the finest computer book I've ever read.. almost riveting! Buy this book!&quot; - reader's review.
