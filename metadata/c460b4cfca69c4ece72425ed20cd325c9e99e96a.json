It was nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album and Best Engineered Non-Classical Album at the 1999 Grammys, winning the latter two awards. The Globe Sessions reached #2 on the UK Album Chart, while peaking at #5 on the Billboard 200 chart, achieving US sales of two million as of January 2008.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Tom Lanham - For some fairly shallow performers, there comes a time when their craft becomes a chore, when scribbling songs for the big follow-up album turns into a black-and-white deadline. Clever composers can almost disguise this ennui, burying it in a smarmy, sunshine-beaming mix. Key word: almost. Ergo, a trial spin through clever composer Sheryl Crow's The Globe Sessions evokes the faintest hint of a feeling that grows stronger with each successive listening--there's no sense that the artist intended this material as anything more than tepid album filler. A conversation with your local supermarket checkout girl would prove far more riveting than Crow's pretentious and all-too-casual observations (set to the tune, it must be noted, of some likable, jangly hooks). &quot;Get out the camera, take a picture / The drag queens and the freaks are all out on the town,&quot; she purrs over chucka-chucka choogling on &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood,&quot; which is probably what any self-respecting drag queen or freak would mutter once Crow moved in, scrounging for her now-patented vicarious cool. The closest The Globe Sessions comes to any palpable sincerity is during an actually-might've-lived-it, whoops-I'm-in-trouble-again &quot;Mississippi.&quot; Even then, Crow drowns the moment in perfectly enunciated syllables, more prissy than alleycat-prowling. Crow started out with a credible Tuesday Night Music Club pedigree, surrounded by visionaries such as David Baerwald (For this disc, she relies heavily on ex-Wire Train mainstay Jeff Trott). But they're gone, and things change, to the point where, if you support this silly sycophant with your hard-earned dollars, there's only one question that you'll need to be asked: Do you want paper or plastic? \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] My Favorite Mistake\n[02] There Goes The Neighborhood\n[03] Riverwide\n[04] It Don't Hurt\n[05] Maybe That's Something\n[06] Am I Getting Through (Part I &amp; II)\n[07] Anything But Down\n[08] The Difficult Kind\n[09] Mississippi\n[10] Members Only\n[11] Crash And Burn\t[Subway - Bonus Hidden Track 07:13]\n[11] Crash And Burn\t[Split]\n[12] Subway \t\t[Split - Bonus Hidden Track]\n\nBonus Music Video\n\n[01] Sheryl Crow - My Favourite Mistake\n\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:59m:27s (Excluding Split Tracks)\nTotal File Size\t&gt;430 mb (Including FLAC, Video, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Quicktime\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 21 September 1998\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow\n&gt;\n&gt;[My Favourite Mistake]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c460b4cfca69c4ece72425ed20cd325c9e99e96a","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+The+Globe+Sessions+-+Sheryl+Crow+430mn+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c460b4cfca69c4ece72425ed20cd325c9e99e96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,96,180,207,202,105,196,236,231,36,37,237,32,205,50,92,158,153,233,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
