Completely destroying all\nboundaries - this is the new sound of the Raised\nFist republic!\n\nOver the years RF has become a well respected name\nin the hardcore scene. Formed back in 1993 when the\nscene in Europe started to simmer, the band took it\nfirst steps with influences taken mainly from bands\nas Gorilla Biscuits and Youth Of Today. A couple of\nearly ep?s, followed by the three full-length\nalbums ?Fuel?(?98), ?Ignoring The Guidelines? (?00)\nand ?Dedication? (?02) has lead to a gradual\nmusical development, as well as earning them fine\ncriticism from many leading music-magazines as well\nas massive support and legendary cult-status among\nthe kids.\n\nWith the ferocious onslaught, variety and\nflexibility and musical maturity of ?Sound Of The\nRepublic?, Raised Fist lead by mad-man Alexander\n&quot;Alle&quot; Rajkovic, and strengthened by the\nrecruitment of Matte Modin&amp;#039;s (Dark Funeral) razor\nsharp drumming, in addition with the excellent work\nof producer Daniel Bergstrand (In Flames,\nMeshuggah, Strapping Young Lad) has come up with a\nrecord that certainly will be a milestone in the\nbands career as well as shaping the European\nhardcore/metal landscape in 2006.\n\nRaised Fist deliver sheer brutality - a pissed of\naggression that makes you feel like you are being\nrepeatedly battered in the faced with a large\nhammer. As painful as it may sound - if you don&amp;#039;t\nlike getting sonically ridden over - just look\nelsewhere!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5c2be37f2bbe07ea418871cec31a3c528fa52c","amp;dn":"Raised_Fist-Sound_of_the_Republic-2006-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5c2be37f2bbe07ea418871cec31a3c528fa52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,92,43,227,127,43,190,7,234,65,136,113,206,195,26,60,82,143,165,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
