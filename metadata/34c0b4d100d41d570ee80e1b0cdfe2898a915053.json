ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why terms like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œretroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthrowbackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ got tossed around when Lewis and his group, the Honeybears, burst onto the scene in 2009 with Tell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Em What Your Name Is!. But Lewis has always been more than a one-trick pony, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never been more apparent than on his sophomore album, Scandalous.\n\nSure, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got the hard-living, woman-chasing schtick down pat: On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMustang RanchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he recounts the time he visited a brothel and paid $20 to get his (ahem) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œham glazed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBooty CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a rollicking good time, and letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack SnakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is not about a reptile. But if you listen closely, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear funky background vocals, tales of true heartbreak and even a love song amidst all the scandal.\n\nThe group manages to blend its influences so effectively that songs with full horn sections somehow sound stripped-down, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear that Scandalous is a stronger record than Tell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Em. Lewis, who didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pick up a guitar until age 20, demonstrates his growing musical prowess, the Honeybears sound tighter, and perhaps most importantly, the album never falls victim to gimmicks. Scandalous isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a throwback, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a throw forward.\n\ncd ripped by a SMUG1 on EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/black-joe-lewis-the-honeybears/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c0b4d100d41d570ee80e1b0cdfe2898a915053","amp;dn":"Black+Joe+Lewis+%26+The+Honeybears...Scandalous%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c0b4d100d41d570ee80e1b0cdfe2898a915053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,192,180,209,0,212,29,87,14,232,14,27,12,223,226,137,138,145,80,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
