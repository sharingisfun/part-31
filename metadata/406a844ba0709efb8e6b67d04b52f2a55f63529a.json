Although he is best known for his striking and elegantly composed Japanese-inspired woodblock prints, Vallotton was also a skilled painter, creating works that arrestingly combined technical perfection with emotional realism. This seminal text provides readers with a fascinating assessment of the career of this revolutionary artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406a844ba0709efb8e6b67d04b52f2a55f63529a","amp;dn":"Best+of+Felix+Vallotton+%28Art%3A+History%29+-Brodskaia-+Epub+%5BSlender","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406a844ba0709efb8e6b67d04b52f2a55f63529a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,106,132,75,160,112,158,251,142,107,103,208,75,82,242,165,95,99,82,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
