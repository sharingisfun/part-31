THAT THESE UNFORTUNATES SEEK AFAR THE GOODNESS WHOSE\r\nSOURCE WITHIN THEY BEAR.\r\n\r\nFOR FEW KNOW HAPPINESS: PLAYTHINGS OF THE PASSIONS, HITHER;\r\nHITHER TOSSED BY ADVERSE WAVES, UPON A SHORELESS SEA, THEY\r\nBLINDED ROLL, UNABLE TO RESIST OR TO THE TEMPEST YIELD.\r\n\r\nGOD! THOU COULDST SAVE THEM BY OPENING THEIR EYES.\r\n\r\nBUT NO: 'TIS FOR THE HUMANS OF A RACE DIVINE TO DISCERN ERROR,\r\nAND TO SEE THE TRUTH.\r\n\r\nNATURE SERVES THEM....\r\n\r\n... THOU WHO FATHOMED IT. O WISE AND HAPPY MAN, REST IN ITS HAVEN.\r\n\r\nBUT OBSERVE MY LAWS, ABSTAINING FROM THE THINGS WHICH THY\r\nSOUL MUST FEAR, DISTINGUISHING THEM WELL; LETTING INTELLIGENCE\r\nO'ER THY BODY REIGN.\r\n\r\nSO THAT, ASCENDING INTO RADIANT ETHER, MIDST THE IMMORTALS,\r\nTHOU SHALT BE THYSELF A GOD.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SUTRAS OF PYTHAGORAS ON PERFECTION.... The first thing to be remembered: that perfection is not a goal. No enlightened person has ever been goal- oriented; he cannot be. Goal-orientation is the way of the mind. Mind exists through goals, mind exists in the future, mind exists in ambition. Mind is always an achieving mind.\r\n..........................\r\nBut first you have to recognize God in you, then you will be able to recognize him everywhere. Once he is known within, he is known without too. And to know God within and without is to know truth, is to know freedom - is to know all that is worth knowing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d077b5277f23022e2a330c41ce8dc7aabdd8b05f","amp;dn":"Osho_Philosophia+Perennis_vol2_%2311_Pythagoras+last+sutras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d077b5277f23022e2a330c41ce8dc7aabdd8b05f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,119,181,39,127,35,2,46,42,51,12,65,206,141,199,170,189,216,176,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
