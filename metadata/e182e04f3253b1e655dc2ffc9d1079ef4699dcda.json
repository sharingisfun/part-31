Since this day, the movement is organized by a flotilla of independent but allied vessels.  \n \nIn this short time, the friendly vessels were able to capture copious amounts of booty, all claimed in the name of #AntiSec. Make no mistake: While the LulzBoat is still sailing with us (albeit not with the LulzSec flag), the objective of #AntiSec is different. Despite being still driven by Lulz and therefore also providing them, the mission has become larger than us. #AntiSec is more than Lulz and more than even Anonymous: It is our true belief that this movement has the capability to change the world. And should that fail, we will at least rock the world.\n   \nThus, the introductory #AntiSec release (dubbed AntiSec-001) does not contain the type of data that a typical Lulz Lizard can just abuse mindlessly. Instead, we provide material that is primarily against corrupt Governments (in our world this is all Governments) and corrupt companies. And keep in mind: #AntiSec vessels have a very large cache of valuable goods aboard; the crews are currently working hard to sort the loot in a way that even the lousy media sailboats are able to just grab it and sail away for the horizon. You will hear from us very soon.\n \nAnd always remember: Let it flow and it will flow back to you.\n\n#AntiSec\nirc.anonops.li","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e182e04f3253b1e655dc2ffc9d1079ef4699dcda","amp;dn":"antisec01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e182e04f3253b1e655dc2ffc9d1079ef4699dcda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,130,224,79,50,83,177,230,85,220,47,252,157,16,121,239,70,153,220,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
