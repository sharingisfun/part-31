At least, that's what's supposed to happen in theoryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ in theoryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ never mind.\n\nActually, even though I never asked for it, I have a DVD reader taking up space inside my laptop. I've never used it for anything like music or movies, but it was required in order for me to install a program once (that was a few years ago). For in order to make the device do its magical &quot;music / movie&quot; playing thing, I would be required to install &quot;special software&quot; (device driver software) that would allow the hardware to recognize and read &quot;specially formed data&quot; from an *actual* DVD disk. Not a &quot;CD&quot; disk. A &quot;DVD&quot; disk; the distinction being contingent on software running at such ridiculously high IRQL's [pronounced &quot;Er-kls&quot;] as 2! Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ or perhaps Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ maybe Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ EVEN BEYONDÃ¢â‚¬Â¼Ã¢â‚¬Â¼).\n\nActually, truth be told, having software run at extremely high priorities is not always a good thing. For one thing, CTRL-ALT-DEL could stop working. If anything bad happened (or &quot;seemed to happen&quot; as it usually goes with these things), it's pull-the-plug and no way 'round it. But there *are* benefits to having software run a extreme priorities too. For one thing, if it's a movie and there's a lot of action going on, then now is not the time to start downloading your mail or checking if Windows Update has reached the requisite 2000 potential and critical failures before starting a new update cycle.\n\nBut I do babble. The point is, an AVI file (and proper codec configuration) gives you the best of both worlds. Your AVI player should defer all that important high priority stuff to a whole other processor (the video card's processor) so that, evidently, there's little or no impact on your computer's performance while at the same time the action can be as packed as action-packed-possible! Your machine could even decide, on a whim, to download your mail and you would not notice a hitch. CTRL-ALT-DEL will work as normal.\n\nSo that's why I copied the contents of the VIDEO_TS folder from this Billie Holiday DVD into an AVI container. I HAVE NOT MADE ANY CHANGES WHATSOEVER to the data. In fact, as you can see below, it is still in &quot;interlaced&quot; format, just like a regular old DVD. \n\nBecause it *is* a DVD. Only without the plastic and the special software.\n\nAnd the pain.\n\n********************************************************\n\nTrack List (See cover.jpg for authors):\n--------------------------------------\n01.
