The last triceratops, the last mermaid, the last dragon? They go to the Hiding Place, a refuge for those whose time on Earth is soon to pass. At first, the Hiding Place seems like an idyllic paradise, filled with satyrs, unicorns and jackalopes. But what happens when a young human boy named Jonathan arrives? Is he the result of an administration error? Or could his appearance be evidence of a more serious problem?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c536f641c23da0238121c318301f483c656018","amp;dn":"The+Hiding+Place","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c536f641c23da0238121c318301f483c656018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,197,54,246,65,194,61,160,35,129,33,195,24,48,31,72,60,101,96,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
