Married to T-Bone Burnett for many years he also produced several of these efforts.  Many people I know used to write her off as &quot;Producer's wife&quot; saying she'd be nothing without the props T-Bone would put around her.  Well folks, even the best producers in the world need material to work with and Sam Philips wrote 99% of this material so I'd put it that she made T-Bone Burnett look good.  Truly a one-of-a-kind artist deserving of wider attention.  \n\nHere are the albums:\n\nA Boot and a Shoe\nCruel Inventions\nFan Dance\nMartinis &amp; Bikinis\nOmnipop (It's Only A Flesh Wound Lambchop)\nSam Phillips Live February 5, 2005\nThe Indescribable Wow\nThe Turning\n\nEnjoy and please seed!;-}\n\nJunco ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e971ac42b7c2614a0435705b4ba7cfbe8986dd2","amp;dn":"Sam+Phillips+-+8+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e971ac42b7c2614a0435705b4ba7cfbe8986dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,151,26,196,43,124,38,20,160,67,87,5,180,186,124,251,232,152,109,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
