Ellen E. Schultz, an award-winning investigative reporter formerly of The Wall Street Journal, reveals how large employers and the retirement industry have all played a huge and hidden role in the death spiral of American pensions and benefits.\n \nA little over a decade ago, pension plans were fat. But companies used slick accounting and dubious loopholes to turn their pension plans into piggy banks, tax shelters, and profit centers. As pensions weakened, companies slashed benefits for workers while doling out gargantuan pensions to their top executives.\n  \nDrawing on original analysis of company data, government filings, and confidential memos, Schultz uncovers decades of widespread deception during which employers exaggerated their retiree burdens while tricking employees, misleading shareholders, and lobbying for taxpayer handouts.\n \n  \n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e9124bfea803d4986e762fb69954aad4a70591","amp;dn":"Retirement+Heist+-+How+companies+plunder+and+profit+-+Ellen+Schu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e9124bfea803d4986e762fb69954aad4a70591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,233,18,75,254,168,3,212,152,110,118,47,182,153,84,170,212,167,5,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
