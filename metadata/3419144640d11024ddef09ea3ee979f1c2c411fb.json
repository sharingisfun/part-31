Hoagland,                   Rizwan  Virk\nFormer space science museum curator and former NASA consultant Richard C. Hoagland discussed the latest discoveries of the Mars rover as well as updates on space and energy exploration. While the rover Opportunity continues its mission on Mars, the newer rover Curiosity, which landed on the Red Planet at Gale Crater about a year ago, has been &quot;making the most astonishing discoveries,&quot; he said, adding that NASA has been posting &quot;mind-blowing&quot; photographs without comment. Curiosity is the mission that's going to officially unveil what's really on Mars, he added. \n&quot;Gale Crater is a stunning treasure trove of ancient, intelligently-made artifacts, currently in ruin,&quot; and this is the reason the site was chosen, as part of a &quot;safe disclosure&quot; plan, Hoagland continued. Among the artifacts are objects that look like a shoe, an engine, and a cylinder (see related photos), he detailed. The location Curiosity landed on is basically &quot;the destroyed, flooded, buried, and then eroded suburbs of an ancient urban complex,&quot; built around a huge mountain in the middle of Gale Crater, he asserted. On Earth, you have a vigorous oxygen atmosphere, so things rust and oxidize but Mars &quot;has been for millions of years a giant planetary museum with no oxygen, so things rust at an incredibly tiny rate,&quot; he explained. For more on the Curiosity, see his new paper, It Only Takes ONE White Crow. \nHe spoke of his &quot;Accutron&quot; inertial system which he's used in experiments to measure torsion effects at sites such as ancient Mexican pyramids. His testing methods can also be employed to evaluate possible new free energy devices, he claimed. According to Hoagland, &quot;the energy that's driving the torsion field itself is coming from a higher dimension, and so you have an unlimited source to draw upon, and shouldn't have to pay a nickel for power from the meter.&quot; \nZen Entrepreneurship\nFirst hour guest, technology trailblazer Rizwan Virk talked about the concept of Zen entrepreneurship, which involves accessing self-knowledge and reflection. In terms of developing the best career path for oneself, he suggested finding the intersection of three different areas-- what it is that you love to do, what it is that you're good at, and what the existing market wants or will pay for. He also recommended paying attention to individualized clues that the universe or your environment puts out before you, which may come in the form of hunches or synchronicities.  \nNews segment guests: Douglas Hagmann, Peter Davenport\nWebsite(s):\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ enterprisemission.com\nzenentrepreneur.com\nBook(s):\n The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever\n Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA\n Zen Entrepreneurship\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3419144640d11024ddef09ea3ee979f1c2c411fb","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+July+02%2C+2013+-+Mars+Discoveries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3419144640d11024ddef09ea3ee979f1c2c411fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,25,20,70,64,209,16,36,221,239,9,234,62,233,121,241,194,196,17,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
