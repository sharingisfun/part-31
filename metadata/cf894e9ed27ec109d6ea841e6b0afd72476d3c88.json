He did not just killÃ¢â‚¬â€he ripped with a butcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gleeÃ¢â‚¬â€and then, after the particularly gruesome slaying of Mary Jane Kelly, he disappeared. For 127 years, Jack has haunted the dark corners of our imagination, the paradigm of the psychotic killer. We remember him not only for his crimes, but because, despite one of the biggest dragnets in London history, he was never caught.\n\nI, Ripper is a vivid reimagining of JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal story entwined with that of an Irish journalist who covered the case, knew the principals, charted the investigation, and at last, stymied, went off in a bold new direction. These two men stalk each other through a city twisted in fear of the madmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blade, a cat-and-mouse game that brings to life the sounds and smells of the fleshpot tenderloin of Whitechapel and all the lurid acts that fueled the Ripper headlines.\n\nDripping with intrigue, atmosphere, and diabolical twists, this is a magnificent psychological thriller from perennial New York Times bestseller Stephen Hunter, who the San Francisco Examiner calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the best storytellers of his generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf894e9ed27ec109d6ea841e6b0afd72476d3c88","amp;dn":"I%2C+Ripper+-+Stephen+Hunter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf894e9ed27ec109d6ea841e6b0afd72476d3c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,137,78,158,210,126,193,9,214,234,132,30,107,10,253,114,71,109,60,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
