IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Hold My Breath \nPicking up the baton from previous BBC Sound of the Year winners Adele and Little Boots, Ellie Goulding is the latest break-out star of British pop. Defying pigeon-holers and hacks everywhere, Goulding's sound blends dance, folk, pop, electronica and everything in between.\n\nGoulding developed her sound with the help of British electro-pop genius Frankmusik, culminating in the release of debut album Lights.The record shuns clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d pop beats and subject matter, replacing them with infectious, danceable tunes and heartfelt lyrics.\n\nFirst single Under the Sheets is the template, an electro-soaked dance track with Goulding's processed voice tugging at the heart-strings. Get used to it: it's the sound of 2010.\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n\n[img]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o219/uuffoo/vghlr7.png[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ec71128edbae831ed0b8b467e638b162066f50","amp;dn":"Ellie_Goulding-Lights-2010-%28split+tracks+%2Bcover%29barney%5C%27s+rg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ec71128edbae831ed0b8b467e638b162066f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,236,113,18,142,219,174,131,30,208,184,180,103,230,56,177,98,6,111,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
