But there is also a lot to learn to master this new medium. \n\nMost of today?s modern digital Single-lens Reflex cameras (DSLR) and some high end digicams support a RAW format. Photographing using the RAW image format will allow you to obtain the best quality from your camera. First, you need to master the RAW file workflow. The RAW image format is the data as it comes directly off the CCD or CMOS sensor, with only rudimentary in-camera processing performed. \n\nOur book provides you with complete introductions to master the digital photography workflow. By following our step-by-step instructions, you will be able to take full advantage of the quality that you camera can provide.  \n\nBe aware that we provide a workflow that works for us. Once you have learned our way of doing things, you then will improve and find your own personal workflow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0110a8ec2f5d4715d5b31b6ed21cc683f319642","amp;dn":"Digital+Photography+Workflow+Handbook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0110a8ec2f5d4715d5b31b6ed21cc683f319642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,17,10,142,194,245,212,113,93,91,49,182,237,33,204,104,63,49,150,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
