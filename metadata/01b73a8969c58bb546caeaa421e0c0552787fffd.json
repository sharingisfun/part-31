While recording Achtung Baby, there was a rift between band members over the direction of the band's sound. Tensions almost prompted U2 to break-up until the band rallied around the writing of &quot;One&quot;. The song is widely considered to be one of the band's greatest songs and is consistently featured in lists of the greatest songs of all time. It was named the 36th greatest song by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and #1 on Q Magazine 's list of the 1001 Greatest Songs of All-Time. VH1 ranked the song #2 in its list of &quot;Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot;. The song reached #7 in the UK charts, and #10 in the US charts, and reached the top of the US Mainstream Rock Tracks and the US Modern Rock Tracks charts. It peaked at #10 on the Dutch Top 40.\n\n&quot;One&quot; was ranked #36 in the List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the highest ranked U2 song. The track was also voted #1 on Q Magazine's &quot;1001 Best Songs Ever&quot; list, and the 5th most popular song of all time in a poll conducted by Sony. A listener's poll conducted by the popular Israeli radio station Galgalatz ranked &quot;One&quot; as the best song of the 1990s, and in April 2006 it was voted as having Britain's number one lyric ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;One life, with each other, sisters, brothers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by a VH1 poll. In a recent poll, the listeners of the Portuguese radio RFM voted &quot;One&quot; as the best song ever, while VH1 listed the song at #2 on the Top 100 Songs of the 1990s.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b73a8969c58bb546caeaa421e0c0552787fffd","amp;dn":"U2+-+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b73a8969c58bb546caeaa421e0c0552787fffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,183,58,137,105,197,139,181,70,202,234,164,33,224,192,85,39,135,255,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
