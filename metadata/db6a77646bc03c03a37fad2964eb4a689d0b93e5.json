I highlight that from Wikipedia to show that I am not the only person moved by this song, and these episodes. \n\nAs such I wanted to make this song more widely available, as I had to search extensively just to find it. I don't believe this to breaking any copy write laws as the song can be found at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.themusichutch.com/listen.php?songid=10903&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.themusichutch.com/listen.php?songid=10903&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI just recorded it, and put it into MP3 format for ease of use. \n\nThe Orchestra version can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://beemp3.com/download.php?file=7743197&amp;song=Orchestral+Suite+from+the+Inner+Light&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://beemp3.com/download.php?file=7743197&amp;song=Orchestral+Suite+from+the+Inner+Light&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHowever there are intermitant high pitched beeps which ruins it.\n\nEnjoy! and please seed at least a 1:1 ratio...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db6a77646bc03c03a37fad2964eb4a689d0b93e5","amp;dn":"Inner+Light+by+Jay+Chattaway+%28Folk+Melody+from+StarTrek+6x19%3A+Le","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db6a77646bc03c03a37fad2964eb4a689d0b93e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,106,119,100,107,192,60,3,163,127,173,41,100,235,74,104,157,11,147,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
