Originally compared with Gotthard (and not only for their Swiss origin), Shakra, Wig Wam and  the like, Maxxwell's sound and style is Euro guitar driven hard rock with a modern sound.\nBut for this new record which is 3 years in the making , Maxxwell's sound has evolved on a personal level, In Gilberto Melendez the band has a new vocalist, and this guy can really 'sing'. powerfully versatile vocals that bring life to the tracks and that's all good because the band vary in their musicical styles regularly, now Gilberto is one of the great strengths, of the quintet, and it shows with the song variety on &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;.\nMAXXWELL have taken full risk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ replacing the leadsinger can either trigger or paralyse a band. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very obvious that with Gilberto MelÃƒÂ©ndez the former is true. Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Tabula RasaÃ¢â‚¬Å“ shoots from the hips very easily, wins you over with massive guitarpower and with a voice that cannot be beat when it comes to catchiness and the wealth of variety. Diverse, heavy, dynamic, curious and straight. MAXXWELL are definitely lookinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for international comparison and can easily compete.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere on &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; we find honest hard rockers with an anthemic, stadium feel vibe as on tracks like &quot;PartyKings&quot;, the kickin' &quot;Cause I'm Lovin' It&quot;, the fun &quot;Man Of Steel&quot; - with some cliche style lyrics but they're catchy as hell - the hot &quot;On Your Face&quot; and the bonus track &quot;Turn Me On&quot;.\nMaxxwell also explore more updated sounds and modern rock waves as on the bass driven &quot;Trails Of Hate&quot; where some heavy guitar appears but during the verses are pretty clean, and where the vocalist changes the octaves for good effect.\n&quot;Fallin' Down&quot; is another different cut, with an almost poppy melody although filled with razor riffs, while the melodic midtempo &quot;Nothing Changes My Mind&quot; (really strong chorus) is one of the highlights with an intense guitar solo.\n&quot;Backstabber&quot; is perhaps the more experimental track as features a rapper called Polemikk, resulting into something comparable to Faith No More, which offers another avenue explored and although it's been done before it remains interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course there's a couple of ballads, one being the single &quot;Gone Forever&quot;, in my opinion is the weakest song on the record, but nevertheless on a par with Alter Bridge ballads however this doesn't detract from the tracks obvious focus for modern rock radio though the accompanying video is fantastic. &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; is much, much better with a positive rocking vein\nAll in all, a very good rock album, which is on a par (I would say) with the likes of Alter Bridge and definitely one for the collection. This is a keeper for traditional Hard Rockers and modern orientated listeners alike.\nProduction is detailed, everything sounding polished and clear and the mix is superb, get some headphones on Play it loud .\n\n\nMaxxwell Discography:\nDogz on Dope (CD - 2009)\nAll in (CD -2011)\nSlapshot (EP - 2012)\n\n\nLine-Up:\nGilberto &quot;Gilbi&quot; MelÃƒÂ©ndez - Vocals\nHef HÃƒÂ¤fliger - Lead Guitar\nCyril Montavon - Rhythm Guitar, Backing Vocals\nKusi Durrer - Bass\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Maxxwell\nAlbum: Tabula Rasa\nGenre: Hard Rock / Melodic Rock\nCountry Of Origin: Switzerland (Luzern)\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaying Time: 00:58:55\nSize: 136 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\nTracklist\n01.
