Everything changes when a vicious pack of outlaws raids their party, stealing the women and nearly killing Frank. He knows Val DooleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gang is behind the kidnappings, and he vows revenge. Audie winner George GuidallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narration perfectly complements this tale of hot lead and revenge.
