He brutally invades Mooky's life and turns it upside-down. During Mookys teenage years, which are affected by his seductive mother Tinka (Efrat Ben-Zur), he deals with unfulfilled love for one girl (Riff Cohen) and a dominated relationship with another, Rocha, (the wonderful Sivan Levy). One day Mooky returns to his mother's home, deranged, and does something from which there is no turning back. Twenty years later, Mooky must decide whether to attend his mother's funeral and re-open his wounds of the past. \n\nGeneral\n\nVideo Format......: Xvid           \nFile Size....: 715 MB\nDuration.....: 1h 46mn\nBitrate......: 3 799 Kbps\nSource.......: DVD\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1514822/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1514822/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nChannels........: 2 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage........: Hebrew\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a950a69940640a0159757c4360b771368c499c30","amp;dn":"Burning.Mooki.DVDRip.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a950a69940640a0159757c4360b771368c499c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,80,166,153,64,100,10,1,89,117,124,67,96,183,113,54,140,73,156,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
