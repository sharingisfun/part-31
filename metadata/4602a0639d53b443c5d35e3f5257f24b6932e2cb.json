After starting the year with the massive &quot;Infected Headphones&quot; and filthy\n follow up &quot;Drug Pusher&quot;, Tyke now unleashes the Nightmare EP - 6 tracks of grimy\n dance floor orientated Drum and Bass which stand out from the crowd for all the right\n reasons!\n\n &quot;Nightmares&quot; kicks off the EP, and after chilling synths and an eerie sample, Tyke\n brings the pain with his trademark bass once again taking no prisoners. Offering no\n let up &quot;Dr DeathÃƒâ€ , ÃƒÂ¦Aliens&quot;, and &quot;Jaguar&quot; all hit home Tyke's talent for producing\n tracks that rock the dance floor every single time. &quot;The Number&quot; and Own It's round\n off the Nightmare EP in manic fashion. Featuring chaotic breaks and yet another rude\n bassline, &quot;Own It' bares all the hallmarks of another outrageous Tyke release.\n\n Support for this EP already from Crissy Criss, DJ Hype, DJ Marky, Hazard, Grooverider\n and many more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4602a0639d53b443c5d35e3f5257f24b6932e2cb","amp;dn":"%5BDrum+and+Bass%5D+Tyke+-+Nightmares+EP+-+JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4602a0639d53b443c5d35e3f5257f24b6932e2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,2,160,99,157,83,180,67,197,211,94,63,82,87,242,75,105,50,226,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
