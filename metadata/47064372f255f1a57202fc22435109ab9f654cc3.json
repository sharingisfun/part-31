Adam invites young readers to learn about AS from his perspective. In this book, Adam helps children understand the difficulties faced by a child with AS; he tells them what AS is, what it feels like to have AS and how they can help children with AS by understanding their differences and appreciating their many talents. This book is ideally suited for boys and girls between 7 and 15 years old and also serves as an excellent starting point for family and classroom discussions.\n\nReview\n'This little gem of a book is intended to be shared by parents or a child with Asperger's Syndrome with friends, family and school professionals and peers so that they may understand asperger Syndrome. [It] could be a very effective tool in establishing understanding and a circle of friends for a child with Asperger's syndrome aged 6-12. It includes simple but charming illustrations by artist, Jane Telford, and an excellent list of resources at the end of the book. This book packs a lot of wisdom and information into a small package.' ---Autism Coach Website\n\n'This is a brief book written to explain Asperger Syndrome, both to classmates and individuals on the spectrum ... It is sufficiently brief for a young audience, but also gives good, specific examples.' ---The MAAP\n\n'Jude Welton gives the young child with Asperger's the power of his own voice in explaining himself to his friends. Her calm and deceptively simple approach is complemented by Jane Telford's reassuringly everyday pictures. Parents have needed this book for a very long time.' - --Elizabeth Newson, Early Years Diagnostic Centre","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47064372f255f1a57202fc22435109ab9f654cc3","amp;dn":"Can+I+Tell+You+About+Asperger+Syndrome%3F%3A+A+Guide+for+Friends+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47064372f255f1a57202fc22435109ab9f654cc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,6,67,114,242,85,241,165,114,2,252,34,67,81,9,171,159,101,76,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
