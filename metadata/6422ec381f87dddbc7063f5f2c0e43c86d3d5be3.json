They call it 'precision targeting'; their critics say it's assassination. A six-month investigation by Dispatches has gone inside the US 'kill/capture' programme to discover new evidence of the strategy's impact, and its costs. The team have talked to key figures in the US military, to US spies and to Taliban commanders and fighters. Gen David Petraeus, since he took command of troops last year, has ordered a major expansion of these 'manhunt' missions that rely on highly classified intelligence, cutting-edge technology and Special Operations forces. Correspondent Stephen Grey and producer Dan Edge explore the logic behind the kill/capture policy, and ask if this unremitting pursuit of the enemy will help end the war in Afghanistan.\n\nCh4 Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-92/episode-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-92/episode-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 48mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.40 GB\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6422ec381f87dddbc7063f5f2c0e43c86d3d5be3","amp;dn":"Ch4+Dispatches+Americas+Secret+Killers+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6422ec381f87dddbc7063f5f2c0e43c86d3d5be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,34,236,56,31,135,221,219,199,6,63,95,44,14,67,200,109,61,91,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
