To escape the perils of the polar winter that brings freezing temperatures, starvation and four months of perpetual night, the dinosaurs of the Arctic come together in colossal herds to make their annual thousand-mile march. The film follows one of the most vulnerable members of the herd, a young edmontosaurus undertaking its first migration, as he struggles to survive the perils of the prehistoric Arctic. From the gangs of albertosaurus hunting under the Northern Lights to the mass dinosaur crossing of a river full of monsters, the film explores a hauntingly beautiful, but perilous, lost landscape.\n\nITV Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.itv.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c955c828123822b3214b07c6e4c130d7d2382525","amp;dn":"ITV+March+of+the+Dinosaurs+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c955c828123822b3214b07c6e4c130d7d2382525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,85,200,40,18,56,34,179,33,75,7,198,228,193,48,215,210,56,37,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
