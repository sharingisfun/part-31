King (guitar, vocals - born September 16, 1925)\n\nKing is reigned across the decades as the genre's most recognizable and influential artist. His half-century of success owes much to his hard work as a touring musician who consistently logged between 200 and 300 shows a year. Through it all he's remained faithful to the blues while keeping abreast of contemporary trends and deftly incorporating other favored forms - jazz and pop, for instance - into his musical overview. Much like such colleagues and contemporaries as Buddy Guy and John Lee Hooker, B.B. King managed to change with the changing times while adhering to his blues roots.\n\nAs a guitarist, King is best-known for his single-note solos, played on a hollowbody Gibson guitar. King's unique tone is velvety and regal, with a discernible sting. He's known for his trilling vibrato, wicked string bends, and a judicious approach that makes every note count. King doesn't play chords or slide - instead, he bends individual strings till the notes seem to cry. \n\nMore than any other musician of the postwar era, King brought the blues from the margins to the mainstream. His influence on a generation of rock and blues guitarists - including Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield and Stevie Ray Vaughan - has been inestimable. 'We don't play rock and roll,' he said in 1957. 'Our music is blues, straight from the Delta.' (rockhall.com)\n\n- - -\n\nB.B. King - Electric Blues 1956-1958 \n(2CD Not Now Music 2009)\n\nB.B. King - Singin' the Blues 1956\n\n 1.
