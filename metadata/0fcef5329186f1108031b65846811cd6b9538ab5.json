He is thrown into a different dimension, where he becomes a space rogue and freebooter with strange powers. He finds himself caught in an inter-galactic struggle between space pirates, gigantic robots, dark gods and other-dimensional entities. Very similar to Silver Surfer and Galactus, or Ulysses and the Greek Gods, he is compelled to wander in a universe that is alien to him. It is also known for the quasi-Baroque style of Druillet's artwork, which features Lovecraft's space nightmares mixed with M.C. Escher's influences.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fcef5329186f1108031b65846811cd6b9538ab5","amp;dn":"Lone+Sloane+-+Delirius","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fcef5329186f1108031b65846811cd6b9538ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,206,245,50,145,134,241,16,128,49,182,88,70,129,28,214,185,83,138,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
