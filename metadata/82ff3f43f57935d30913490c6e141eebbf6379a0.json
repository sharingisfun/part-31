He has published some twenty music albums, composed music for films and published several books, including his well-known adaptation of the Gilgamesh epic into French. On his tours throughout Europe, the United States and Mexico, he inspires his audiences with the modernity of his compositions and universality of his poetic messages. His music has long enjoyed the admiration of artists as diverse as Yehudi Menuhin, John Adams, Jeff Buckley, Leonard Cohen or RenÃƒÂ© Char.\n \nAbed AzriÃƒÂ© sees himself primarily as a man of freedom. He believes in the arts as a medium of humanity and is defending an art that is free from entrenched forms and limitations and is aiming directly at man in his universality and timeliness. For him, Ã‚Â« a word which is sung is no longer just a simple word, but it is enchanted, transformed into trance Ã‚Â».\n \nThe texts which he selects for his compositions are from oriental and western, ancient and contemporary poetry, and are written in different languages (Arabic, Spanish, French, Venetian, German and English): Adonis, Andrea Zanzotto, Omar Khayyam, Jean Cocteau, Gibran, Hafiz, Goethe, and others...  All these texts have one thing in common: they are evoking the fullness of life and they celebrate the miracle of life, the freedom of the mind and the opening of the heart.\n \nServing these essential texts, Abed AzriÃƒÂ© is writing a luminous, profound and refined music, which combines in ever renewed ways instruments, rhythms and voices, creating a universe of sound that only belongs to him. His music expresses an exceptional vitality inhabited by a subtle sense of the sacred without reference.\n \nFrom his first album, Le chant nouveau des poÃƒÂ¨tes arabes (1971) up to the latest, Adonis (2011), Abed AzriÃƒÂ© is always in search of previously unheard sounds. Suerte (1994), written for three ensembles, an oriental, western and flamenco ensemble, is floating freely between musical notation and improvisation. Omar Khayyam (1998) presents for the first time Arab singing accompanied by a chamber ensemble. Venessia (2000) sets into music the Venetian texts by Andrea Zanzotto in an organic way. With the Evangile selon Jean (Gospel of John) (2009), Abed AzriÃƒÂ© presents an oratorio for solo voices, mixed chorus and an oriental and western orchestra. Mystic (2007) and L'Ãƒâ€°popÃƒÂ©e de Gilgamesh (Epic of Gilgamesh) (1977 and 2010) identifies key stages of his preoccupation with the oldest texts of mankind, which he set to music for singing.\n \nIn 1990, he signed his first contract with American Nonesuch/Warner for his album Aromates followed by a contract for three albums with Sony Music in 1995. Harmonia Mundi now distributes his music.\n\nTrackList:\n1 - SemaÃƒÂ¯ pour Adonis \n2 - L'autre nostalgie\n3 - Les chemins \n4 - Fleur de l'alchimie \n5 - Commencement du chemin \n6 - Pont de larmes \n7 - Terre d'absence \n8 - PoÃƒÂ¨tes \n9 - Phare ÃƒÂ©teint \n10 - Le vieux pays  \n11 - Commencement de la parole \n12 - Je vis avec la lumiÃƒÂ¨re\n13 - Le temps \n14 - Un chant\n\nDuration : 62:15 | Bitarte : 320 kBit/s | Year : 2012 | full covers\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82ff3f43f57935d30913490c6e141eebbf6379a0","amp;dn":"Abed+Azri%26eacute%3B+-+2012+-+Abed+Azri%26eacute%3B+chante+Adonis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82ff3f43f57935d30913490c6e141eebbf6379a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,255,63,67,245,121,53,211,9,19,73,12,110,20,30,235,191,99,121,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
