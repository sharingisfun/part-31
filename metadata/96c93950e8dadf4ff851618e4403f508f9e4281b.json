The TV sound mix is a bit 'brittle' but listen-able anyway. The Audio and Video feeds are irect from the TV Broadcast Truck. The Sound and Video Sync goes in places, but... it was a Tech Test Video..yeh ? The overall sound mix on the video improves a bit from 1.23 onwards as they 'get to grips' a bit with the vocal / backing track mix and compress the vocal feed from the truck. Fortunately my audio feeds to my main P/A mixer were all separate so I could do my own front of house mix, thankfully.\nThis 'Test' Video reproduced with the kind permission of the GMG Group (UK/ES / GMI Records (UK/ES) / MusoSound (ES) &amp; Madcom (UK) / GuyJayFlix (ES).\n\nEnjoy and thanks for watching.\n\nAll Rights Reserved (Video Content Only).
