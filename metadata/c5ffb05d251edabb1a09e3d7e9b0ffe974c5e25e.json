Always \n        controversial, always outspoken, always uncompromising; Metallica\n        rose from obscurity to take over the world of heavy metal and \n        become the 7th biggest selling act in American history. Now VH1\n        has produced the ultimate no holds barred oral history of \n        Metallica: When Metallica Ruled The World. This one hour long\n        documentary will take you through the band's tumultuous 24 year\n        history and give you the real story behind their recent ups and\n        downs, including James Hetfield's battle with alcohol, Jason \n        Newsted's resignation, and the bands subsequent journey into therapy.\n        \n        The show begins in 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist/vocalist\n        James Hetfield meet each other through &amp;quot;Musician Wanted&amp;quot; ads in a local\n        Los Angeles paper and start a volatile relationship that will drive the\n        band to the top of the heavy metal world and ultimately to the brink of\n        destruction some twenty years later. In between; Metallica's hard\n        partying earns them the infamous nickname &amp;quot;Alcoholica&amp;quot;, they face the\n        tragic death of bassist Cliff Burton, become a worldwide phenomenon\n        with the 1991 release of the Black Album and enrage music fans across\n        America by taking on music-swapping giant Napster. \n         \n        When Metallica Ruled The World tells the tale of the world's most \n        dangerous band through the people who lived it. It brings you inside\n        the nearly three decades of dramatic success, drunken debauchery and\n        tragic setbacks that have made Metallica one of Rock and Roll's greatest\n        stories. \n        \n        INTERVIEWS INCLUDE:\n        \n        James Hetfield - Lead Singer\n        \n        Lars Ulrich - Drummer\n         \n        Jason Newsted - Former Bassist\n          \n        Kirk Hammett - Lead Guitarist\n         \n        Robert Trujillo - Bassist\n          \n        Bob Rock - Producer\n         \n        Sully Erna - Godsmack, Lead Singer\n          \n        Scott Ian - Anthrax, Guitarist\n         \n        Jim Breuer- Comedian\n          \n        Joe Berlinger - Co-Director, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ffb05d251edabb1a09e3d7e9b0ffe974c5e25e","amp;dn":"VH1+When+Metallica+Ruled+The+World+DSRip+XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ffb05d251edabb1a09e3d7e9b0ffe974c5e25e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,255,176,93,37,30,218,187,26,9,227,215,233,176,255,233,116,197,226,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
