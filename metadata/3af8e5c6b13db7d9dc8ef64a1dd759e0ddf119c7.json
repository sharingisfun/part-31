Recently internet dating has become popular.\n\nAlthough dating etiquette in Western culture has become more relaxed during the twentieth century, \nthere are considerable differences between social and personal values. \nFor example, when an activity costs money (for example, a meal), \ntraditionally the man was expected to pay; but in recent times the practice of &quot;going Dutch&quot; \n(splitting the expenses) has become common and acceptable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                               SEX\n\nIn biology, sex is a process of combining and mixing genetic traits, \noften resulting in the specialization of organisms into male and female types (or sexes).\nSexual reproduction involves combining specialized cells (gametes) to form offspring \nthat inherit traits from both parents. Gametes can be identical in form and function \n(known as isogametes), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific \ntypes of gametes (heterogametes) exist: male gametes are small, motile,\n and optimized to transport their genetic information over a distance, while female gametes are large, \nnon-motile and contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of the young organism.\n\nAn organism's sex is defined by the gametes it produces: males produce male gametes \n(spermatozoa, or sperm) while females produce female gametes (ova, or egg cells);\n individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic. \nFrequently, physical differences are associated with the different sexes of an organism; \nthese sexual dimorphisms can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFilename:.........................: Dating &amp; Sex for Dummies\n\nTotal Size:........................: 18.3 Mega Byte\n\nFile Format:......................: PDF \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE:\n \nFor openning PDF files you need Acrobat Reader software.
