Supporting these rapidly evolving technologies requires middleware solutions that address connectivity-level, location-dependent, and context-dependent issues.\n\n-The Handbook of Mobile Middleware is an exhaustive overview of recent developments in the various fields related to this infrastructure software. Authored by internationally recognized experts, this advanced reference integrates valuable insight gained from actual system deployments. It begins by presenting mobile middleware requirements and technologies, then offers solutions organized by such challenges as mobility/disconnection handling, location-based support, and context-based support. This volume focuses on the application domains in which mobile middleware has demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness and details the pros, cons, and trade-offs of each solution.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4546ede49ef6741cbaa90e6e4191c236d7da95cc","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Mobile+Middleware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4546ede49ef6741cbaa90e6e4191c236d7da95cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,70,237,228,158,246,116,28,186,169,14,110,65,145,194,54,215,218,149,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
