The year 2000 alone saw four full-length releases from him; through Nothing Makes Sense Without It, Old Moon in the Arms of the New, You Secretly Want Me Dead, and One Hundred Dollar Room, Barnett gained comparisons to Elliott Smith, Mark Eitzel, Billy Bragg, and Robert Pollard. A self-titled 2001 release compiled re-recorded versions of early material. Barnett's work is also strewn throughout several singles, EP, and various artist releases. Their next record, Bridges Worth Burning, came out in the summer of 2002. The following tour saw his drummer leave, so he simply let him leave and turned the tour into an acoustic one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da9e3b620c1ee8e83539cc75ce9a7db3c5f9f27e","amp;dn":"Kind+of+Like+Spitting+-+Discography+%282000-2015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da9e3b620c1ee8e83539cc75ce9a7db3c5f9f27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,158,59,98,12,30,232,232,53,57,204,117,206,154,125,179,197,249,242,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
