Also, Buena Vista Social Club trumpet player Guajiro Mirabal.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nEmiliano Salvador never achieved the international success of other top Cuban jazzmen such as Paquito D'Rivera, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Arturo Sandoval and Chucho Valdes. In 1992, at age 41, Salvador died in his sleep of a heart attack. Valdes called him &quot;the best pianist of his generation,&quot; and the words &quot;Cuba's Jazz Legend&quot; on the front of this CD's packaging are not mere hype. An accomplished drummer and percussionist, Salvador's piano playing could be intensely rhythmic and driving, and he was a diverse stylist overall, as likely to perform jazz versions of more traditional chachas, sambas, mambos, and danzons as he was to stretch out and burn on straight-ahead Latin jazz tunes.\n-- jazz.com\n\nAn introduction to the highly praised Cuban jazz pianist, one that culls from sessions that span the decade from 1978 to 1988. The album starts out with a piano solo, moves into a tune featuring Bobby Carcases on vocals, and Arturo Sandoval and El Guajiro on trumpets plus a full big band that includes Changuito. It's of its time, sounding American, Brazilian and Cuban all at once, with Salvador tearing it up on piano. Recommended.\n-- descarga.com\n\nEmiliano Salvador is one of those musicians admired by all musicians and specially the ones that play the piano; he is what American jazzmen call a pianist's pianist. Salvador has turned into a legend, not only among Cubans but also in all Afro Caribbean music and Latin jazz scenes.\n-- amazon.com\n\nCheck out a tribute to to Emiliano Salvador I've previously posted here\n\nAfro-Cuban Jazz Project - A Puerto Padre [FLAC] TQMP &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4334407&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4334407&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTracks\n01- Una manana de domingo\n02- Luna Wanestain\n03- En una volanta actual\n04- Para luego es tarde\n05- Puerto Padre\n06- Son de la loma\n07- Zapateo para una bella dama\n08- El montuno\n09- Cancion a Isela\n10- Son en 7/4\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40818bdcbe8daea816cf540c29943609cf904143","amp;dn":"Emiliano+Salvador+-+Puerto+Padre+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40818bdcbe8daea816cf540c29943609cf904143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,129,139,220,190,141,174,168,22,207,84,12,41,148,54,9,207,144,65,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
