Those flac files are included.\n\nI then bought a new copy of Batman OST and ripped that with EAC and included that with a log file.\n\nI don't always do my flac rips with EAC, sometimes I use other rippers that rip into lossless wav format and then use FLAC Front-End to convert it to FLAC format. The reason? EAC is still in beta mode and tends to lock up (the application) on me sometimes and does not work. In this case, it worked flawlessly. (Reason I am explaining this is because one douche actually COMPLAINED on my last soundtrack release (Inception in FLAC) that I didn't include a log file...over FREE music...)\n\nSo here you are, there's a log file for the Batman OST album...\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad3c6d14056ff187a86ac3b1ed1706a9c885206","amp;dn":"Batman+OST+Collection+%28Danny+Elfman%29+FLAC+-+Batman+%2B+Batman+Retu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad3c6d14056ff187a86ac3b1ed1706a9c885206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,211,198,209,64,86,255,24,122,134,172,59,30,209,112,106,156,136,82,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
