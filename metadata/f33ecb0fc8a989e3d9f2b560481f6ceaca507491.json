Roused from his centuries of slumber, the All-Father wanders the Earth until he finds gods old and new. Do they have the answers he seeks? How does an ancient god of war find his place in the modern world?\n\nA musing on the nature of religion and spirituality. We may no longer need a patriarch, but do we need to rediscover our divinities?\n\nJames L. Wilber is a writer, game designer, and ceremonial magician.
