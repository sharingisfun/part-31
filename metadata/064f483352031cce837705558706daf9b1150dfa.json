Their first album, St. Elsewhere, was released in 2006; it and their first hit, &quot;Crazy&quot;, were major commercial successes, and were noted for their large sales by download. The duo released their second album, The Odd Couple, in March 2008.\nSt. Elsewhere (2006ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007)\n\nDowntown/Atlantic in the U.S. and Warners Bros. Records in the UK signed the band after several songs including &quot;Crazy&quot; were played for them by Danger Mouse's management company Waxploitation.[5] &quot;Crazy&quot; was released as their first single on April 3, 2006, preceded by its release as digital download and 12&quot; vinyl record single in March 2006. It gained some of its popularity due to its use on primetime BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe's television advert, and it was also made Record of the Week by Ken Bruce of BBC Radio 2, Scott Mills and Jo Whiley of BBC Radio 1 as well as being made 'Weekend Anthem' by DJ Spoony and Sara Cox (also of Radio 1).\n\n&quot;Crazy&quot; is the first ever single to top the UK singles chart purely on download sales as it was released online a week before it was released as a CD single (although Rage Against the Machine was the first ever Christmas number one entirely from downloads).[6] It is also the first single to top the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks consecutively since 1994 when Wet Wet Wet's &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; was number one for 15 weeks (the last song to spend exactly nine weeks on top was &quot;Two Tribes&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984). It has also equaled the Queen 1975 classic &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which also topped the UK singles chart for nine weeks. Gnarls Barkley announced that as the record had spent its ninth week at number one, it was to be deleted as a vinyl/CD listing from May 28, 2006 so people will &quot;remember the song fondly and not get sick of it&quot;.[7]\n\n&quot;Crazy&quot; is also the longest number-one on the UK Official Download Chart with its stay lasting eleven consecutive weeks. In late 2009 the song was voted as the best song of the decade by Rolling Stone magazine.[8]\n\nThe group released their debut album, St. Elsewhere, on April 24, 2006 in the UK and on May 9, 2006 in the U.S. For their American television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, May 24, 2006, the band performed their smash hit, &quot;Crazy&quot;.\n\nThe band performed along with Christina Aguilera, AFI, and Wolfmother at the MTV Movie Awards 2006 on June 8, 2006.[9] They were dressed as characters from the film series Star Wars: Rebel Alliance pilots, Imperial officers, Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, Jango Fett, Obi-Wan, with Cee-Lo singing as an unmasked Darth Vader.\n\nIn October 2006, Gnarls Barkley recorded a live session for Live from Abbey Road at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nSt. Elsewhere has been certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling over 1,000,000 albums in the U.S.. A limited edition deluxe package of St. Elsewhere was released on November 7, 2006. The CD+DVD package includes a 92-page booklet, four music videos and bonus songs from live performances.\n\nFrom January until March 2007, they toured with the Red Hot Chili Peppers through the United States of America. [1]\n\nThey did a collaborative short film in both the Spring of 2006 and 2007 with the international TV series Kung Faux which airs heavily on Channel V around the world, and they also toured Australia in March and April 2007 as part of the Channel V Festival.\n\nThe song &quot;Go-Go Gadget Gospel&quot; appears in the show The Boondocks. It was sung by Rev. Rollo Goodlove, who was voiced by Cee-Lo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064f483352031cce837705558706daf9b1150dfa","amp;dn":"Gnarls.Barkley.-.St.Elsewhere.%28Retail%29-2006-OR4Y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064f483352031cce837705558706daf9b1150dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,79,72,51,82,3,28,206,131,119,5,85,135,6,218,249,177,21,13,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
