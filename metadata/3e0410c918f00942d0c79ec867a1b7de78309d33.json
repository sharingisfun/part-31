The album is one of the top things to come out of C79, very energetic and well-mastered -- there has been a ton of polish and hard work put into crafting it. It\\'s refreshing to see an electronic album that uses lyrics without butchering them or becoming annoying. If you like happy hardcore or the lighter side of trance, you should be very satisfied with this album. A great album throughout by all regards, highlights for myself are \\&quot;Aviator\\&quot;, \\&quot;Hardcore Addicted 2 Unlimited\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Dreamin\\' Feelin\\' as my top pick. Having heard Noriken\\'s previous albums, most notably Glitters, he\\'s developed and refined his skills immensely. Hopefully you\\'ll find something from this album that connects well with you. \n\nEnjoy the album, and happy new year!\n\n01. Hardcore Addicted 2 Unlimited - DJ Noriken\n02.
