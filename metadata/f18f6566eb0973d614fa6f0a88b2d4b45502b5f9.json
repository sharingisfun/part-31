It shows how the theory of the book can be applied into practice.\n\nThe recording software was left running throughout the entire construction and production of the track and was later edited down to the most pertinant points filling three hours to fit onto the DVD.\n \nSplit into easy to understand sessions, the DVD covers the construction and production used to create Sunset including the inital starting point of getting the ideas down, through to how to approach the synth programming, application of effects, processing and finally arrangement to create the complete track.\n\n\n\n\nSean McRay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18f6566eb0973d614fa6f0a88b2d4b45502b5f9","amp;dn":"Dance+Music+Production+Vol.2%3A+Trance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18f6566eb0973d614fa6f0a88b2d4b45502b5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,143,101,102,235,9,115,214,20,250,111,10,136,178,212,180,85,2,181,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
