Ginnyâ€™s and Jackâ€™s dreams overtake them without warning, leaving their bodies behind while carrying their consciousnesses forward, into the minds of two inhabitants of the Kalpaâ€“a would-be warrior, Jebrassy, and an inquisitive explorer, Tiadbaâ€“who have been genetically retro-engineered to possess qualities of ancient humanity. In turn, the dreams of Tiadba and Jebrassy carry them back, into the minds of Jack and Ginny. As for Daniel: He dreams of an empty darknessâ€“all that his future holds.\r\n\r\nBut more than dreams link Ginny, Jack, and Daniel. They are fate-shifters, born with the ability to skip like stones across the surface of the fifth dimension, inhabiting alternate versions of themselves. And each guards an object whose origin and purpose are unknown: gnarled, stony artifacts called sum-runners that persist unchanged through all versions of time.\r\n\r\nHunted by others with similar powers who seek the sum-runners on behalf of a terrifying, goddess-like entity known as the Chalk Princess, Ginny, Jack, and Daniel are drawn, despite themselves, into an all but hopeless mission to rescue the futureâ€“and complete the greatest achievement in human history.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Charles Leggett\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 48 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215af21552b692b0208abcd3d9329f81faa46eb3","amp;dn":"Greg+Bear+-+City+at+the+End+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215af21552b692b0208abcd3d9329f81faa46eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,90,242,21,82,182,146,176,32,138,188,211,217,50,159,129,250,164,110,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
