It is especially useful on Chromebooks because ChromeOS does not enable direct UPnP access. Homenet LMS does not use UPnP or DLNA. Instead it uses a locally installed Windows, Linux or Mac Web Server. \n\nAs a minimalist lightweight media center focused on speed and simplicity, some features are absent in HomeNet LMS. There are no thumbnails, categories, indexing or other distractions. Try the online demo to view efficient nested text-based directories and files. Unlike often-bloated UPnP/DLNA servers, there is no database to be maintained or updated so disk thrashing and performance concerns are mostly absent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:207a414cdda6d3cd10a727b20d7977ea7c456acc","amp;dn":"PDF+-+HomeNet+WiFi+Media+Server+3.2+-+Plex+%2F+XBMC+lite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"207a414cdda6d3cd10a727b20d7977ea7c456acc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,122,65,76,221,166,211,205,16,167,39,178,13,121,119,234,124,69,106,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
