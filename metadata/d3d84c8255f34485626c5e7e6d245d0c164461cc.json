BATF Doug Carlin is brought in to assist in the massive investigation, and gets attached to an experimental FBI surveillance unit, one that uses spacefolding technology to directly look back a little over four days into the past. While tracking down the bomber, Carlin gets an idea in his head: could they use the device to actually travel back in time and not only prevent the bombing but also the murder of a local woman whose truck was used in the bombing?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453467/\nRelease Date: 22 November 2006 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nStars: Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Val Kilmer\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-KiNGS\nSize: 800MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d84c8255f34485626c5e7e6d245d0c164461cc","amp;dn":"Deja+Vu+%282006%29+BluRay+720p+800MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d84c8255f34485626c5e7e6d245d0c164461cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,216,76,130,85,243,68,133,98,108,94,126,109,36,93,12,22,68,97,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
