The goal is to be the most complete and easy to use free computer diagnostic tool. Almost all software included in UBCD4Win are freeware utilities for Windows. Some of the tools included are &quot;free for personal use&quot; copies so users need to respect these licenses. A few of the tools included in UBCD4Win are paid for and licensed software owned by UBCD4win. On occasion they work with software companies/authors for permission to include their software in the download or have requested their software better support PE. Users can freely share copies of UBCD4Win with friends but selling UBCD4Win for a profit is not acceptable. They have worked hard for many years helping people for free with this project, others should not make money from their hard work. UBCD4Win is based on Bart&amp;#039;s PE. Bart&amp;#039;s PE builds a Windows &quot;pre-install&quot; environment CD, basically a simple Windows XP booted from CD. UBCD4Win includes network support and allows you the ability to modify NTFS volumes, recover deleted files, create new NTFS volumes, scan hard drives for viruses, etc. The download includes almost everything you need to repair your system problems. This project has been put together to be the ultimate recovery cd and not a replacement OS (Operating System).\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ubcd4win.com/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ubcd4win.com/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVersion 3.22 Released on Nov 12, 2008\n\nFeature- Grub4DOS support added to MultiBoot plugins \nFeature- VC++ 2005 Runtime, several programs now require it \nFeature- USB Hot Plug Plugin fixes \nFeature- UBUSB \nAdded- CrossLoop \nAdded- GPU-z 0.2.8 \nUpdated- All Anti-Spyware and Anti-Virus definitions updated 11/9/08 \nUpdated- A-Squared 3.5.0.27 \nUpdated- Auslogics DiskDefrag 1.4.16.308 \nUpdated- AVG Free 7.5.524 \nUpdated- CCleaner 2.12.660 \nUpdated- CPU-z 1.48 \nUpdated- Defraggler 1.03 \nUpdated- DiskImg 1.45 \nUpdated- DriveImage XML 2.02 \nUpdated- Eraser 5.86a \nUpdated- ExpressBurn 4.15 \nUpdated- FileZilla 3.1.3.1 \nUpdated- FireFox 3.0.3 \nUpdated- Foxit Reader 2.3.3309 \nUpdated- FreeCommander 2008.06c \nUpdated- HijackThis 2.0.2 \nUpdated- IDSuite.dat 2.10.1 \nUpdated- ImgBurn 2.4.2 \nUpdated- IPSniffer 1.97.1.2 \nUpdated- Memtest 3.7 \nUpdated- Notepad++ 5.0.3 \nUpdated- nPOPuk 2.11 \nUpdated- Opera 9.60 \nUpdated- Recuva 1.19.350 \nUpdated- RunScanner 1.0.0.22 \nUpdated- SpeedFan 4.35 \nUpdated- SpyBot S&amp;D 1.6.0.30 \nUpdated- Stinger 10.0.1.602 \nUpdated- SuperAntispyware 4.21.1004 \nUpdated- SysInfo 2008.09.08 \nUpdated- TestDisk 6.10 \nUpdated- TrueCrypt 6.01 \nUpdated- Unstoppable Copier 3.56 \nUpdated- WUL 1.23 \nUpdated- xplorer2 1.71.4 \nRemoved- VistaRD, unreliable download \nRemoved- PE2USB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39912582859d25dbd91b47cbdd848a4c10b26e23","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Boot+CD+for+Windows+V3.22+%28UBCD4WinV322.exe%29+12Nov2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39912582859d25dbd91b47cbdd848a4c10b26e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,145,37,130,133,157,37,219,217,27,71,203,221,132,138,76,16,178,110,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
