During recording, you can, with a press of a button, highlight the specific error so that you can investigate the detected error at a later time. CDP+ is equipped with built-in memory thus removing the need to bring a computer. Memory cart not include in package .\n\nMULTI COLOUR INDICATOR             \nWith the multi colour indicator on CDP+, you have full control of the diagnostic process. Different colors and sound communicates the status and the placement of the indicator allows you to see it from a far. For example, if the indicator alternates between blue and green the CDP+ is in communication with the vehicle control unit.\n\n\nVOLTAGE CHECK                                  \nWhen CDP+ is connected to the vehicle, the unit will check the battery voltage of the vehicle and automatically adjusts itself to the vehicleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voltage level of 12 or 24 volts. If the voltage gets too high or too low, CDP+ will warn you with both sound and light and you will also be alerted through the battery icon in our diagnostic software.\n\nCHASSIS NUMBER VIN                         \nIn our CARS software, we have a smart function that allows you to read out the chassis number from the vehicle that you would like to diagnose. This ensures that the right model and year is selected automatically. In addition, engine code for vehicles, which are commonly available on the markets, is also selected automatically.\n\nISS                                                                \nIntelligent System Scan (ISS) scans through all the systems in the vehicle and displays the fault codes that are stored in each system. This saves time and you get a quick overview of the actual status of the entire vehicle. When the ISS is complete, you can then select a specific control system to analyse the results further on.\n\nISI                                                                \nIntelligent System Identification (ISI) identifies and selects automatically the type of controller that is mounted in the vehicle. This ensures that the diagnostic session is performed correctly with the correct parameters as required.\n\nREPORT FUNCTION                               \nUnder this function tab, you will be able to see the adaptations and adjustments that are possible for a specific vehicle without having the vehicle near you. Together with the help texts as a guide, you can plan and be effective in your work; even under complex situations.\n\n\nUNIVERSAL                                                                                             \nFor most OBD functions, such as adjustments and programmings, there are detailed instructions and help texts to assist you in your diagnosis work. You will find step by step information about prerequisites, preparation and implementation of various functions; making even the most complex function simple to perform\n\n  Help function                                      \n \nFor most OBD functions, such as adjustments and programmings, there are detailed instructions and help texts to assist you in your diagnosis work.
