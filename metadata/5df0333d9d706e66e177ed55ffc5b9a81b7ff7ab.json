His Auto-Tuned, Imogen Heap-sampling debut single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Watcha Say,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was an infectious, slick, and on-point way to launch a career, but his debut album is less satisfying, even with plenty of the same well-crafted, futuristic R&amp;B as his breakthrough tune. Since Derulo seems entirely devoted to the song, the problem may lie with the album format itself. This one barely fits the definition at a scant nine songs, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little attention paid to the overall flow -- but if what you're looking for is R&amp;B that sparkles and dazzles, there are nine quick fixes here, each one just dying to get stuck in your head. The talented J.R. Rotem handles the production for the whole show, blurring the lines between dance-pop and R&amp;B on highlights like Ã¢â‚¬Å“In My Head.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clever how Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the LimitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ knicks a bit of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flashdance (What a Feeling)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for its melody, and the bright and shiny Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love HangoverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is equally Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s-flavored besides being a rock-solid tune. As a performer, the smooth Derulo -- made even smoother by Auto-Tune -- delivers it all so effortlessly that none of that persuasive debut hunger comes through, making this stylish and short set one to admire rather than advocate.\nAll Music Review by David Jeffries\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Whatcha Say\n[02] Ridin' Solo\n[03] In My Head\n[04] The Sky's The Limit\n[05] What If\n[06] Love Hangover\n[07] Encore\n[08] Fallen\n[09] Blind\n[10] Strobelight\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:34m:43s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 265mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
