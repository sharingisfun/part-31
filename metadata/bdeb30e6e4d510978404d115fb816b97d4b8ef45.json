I find myself looking at this movie over and over. Its hard to imagine a darker image, or a more overcooked dialog. Almost every noir cliche you can think of is in this movie.\n\nDirected by Robert Florey.\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you download.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdeb30e6e4d510978404d115fb816b97d4b8ef45","amp;dn":"The+Crooked+Way+%281949+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdeb30e6e4d510978404d115fb816b97d4b8ef45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,235,48,230,228,213,16,151,132,4,209,21,251,129,107,151,212,184,239,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
