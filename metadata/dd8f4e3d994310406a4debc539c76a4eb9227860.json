Broken Down (4:23)\n\n&quot;Originally from Mississippi, the Gordian Knot emerged in Los Angeles in 1967. They recorded this fascinating hybrid of Association-esque soft pop/soft psych/country rock with L.A.'s finest studio musicians and the Hi-Lo's own Clark Burroughs in the producer's chair. The result is the finest harmony pop psych offering in the entire Verve catalog. Fronted by Jim Weatherly -- who just a few years later would pen Gladys Knight's finest moment, 'Midnight Train To Georgia,' the Gordian Knot entertained countless in-crowd L.A. parties frequented by Hollywood's elite, and performed as part of a USO tour throughout Vietnam with friend and fan Nancy Sinatra.&quot;\nDescribed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the finest harmony pop psych offering in the entire Verve catalogueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, The Gordian KnotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled debut (and one and only release) is some way from the classy jazz roster that was instrumental in putting the label on the map.\nOriginally released in 1968, the story goes that The Gordian Knot had arrived in LA, via the University Of Mississippi and then New York, and found themselves playing local clubs and the celebrity party circuit in Hollywood. A chance meeting with Nancy Sinatra led to them accompanying her on a United Service Organisations tour of South Vietnam and ultimately landed them a recording deal with Verve.\nProduced by Clark Burroughs of The Hi-LoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, everything about this well-crafted fusion of sunshine pop and gentle psychedelia is geared towards accenting all things melodic, as is ably demonstrated by the standout tracks, The World Keeps Spinning, Year Of The Sun, and Broken Down Old Merry-Go-Round.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8f4e3d994310406a4debc539c76a4eb9227860","amp;dn":"The+Gordian+Knot+-+The+Gordian+Knot+%281968%2F2007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8f4e3d994310406a4debc539c76a4eb9227860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,143,78,61,153,67,16,64,106,77,235,197,57,199,106,78,185,34,120,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
