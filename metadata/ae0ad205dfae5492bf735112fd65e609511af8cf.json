Starring David Wenham and Diana Glenn.\n\n\nEpisodes 1 through 6 are in 960 x 720p, 4200 kbps, x264, mkv and Stereo AAC audio\n\nEpisodes 7 through 10 are in 720 x 400p, 1250 kbps, XviD, avi and Stereo 128 kbps mp3 audio\n\n\nI've compiled these from various Russian sites and removed the Russian audio track. The source files I believe are from iTunes, and even though they are somewhat less sharp compared with other 720p WEB-DLs, these are the best available versions. A fine series, and not widely available, so I hope you keep it alive by seeding after you download!\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae0ad205dfae5492bf735112fd65e609511af8cf","amp;dn":"Killing+Time+%28AUS%2C+2011%29+Complete+Series+720p+WEB-DL+and+WEB-DLR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae0ad205dfae5492bf735112fd65e609511af8cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,10,210,5,223,174,84,146,191,115,81,18,253,101,230,9,81,26,248,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
