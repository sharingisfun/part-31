They explore the depths of a mysterious  \n              labyrinth of melodies, get hypnotized by alien     \n              siren calls and eventually face the power of       \n              really rocky synthesizer riffs. While doing so,    \n              again and again the emotional and thrilling        \n              atmosphere of a movie soundtrack evolves.          \n                                                                \n              Together with the grinding, organic bass sounds,   \n              which float \\\\\\'Across The Sea\\\\\\' like a golden         \n              thread, it becomes pretty clear why Krama          \n              appropriately describe their own music as \\\\\\'Power   \n              Progressive Trance\\\\\\'. By means of the extensive     \n              usage of analogue studio technology the two        \n              producers manage to paint their newest work in a   \n              refreshing variety of different sound colours and  \n              also to create a very cosy feeling of listening\n              pressure.\n\n   \nArtist .......
