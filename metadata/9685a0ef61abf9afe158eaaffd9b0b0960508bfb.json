The selling souls was the thing of the 70s, and this was their sophomore release in the 80s, so that&amp;#039;s out of the question. Maybe a pop-music assassination? \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9685a0ef61abf9afe158eaaffd9b0b0960508bfb","amp;dn":"Plugz+-+Better+Luck+%5B1981%5D+Punk+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9685a0ef61abf9afe158eaaffd9b0b0960508bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,133,160,239,97,171,249,175,225,88,234,175,253,155,11,9,96,80,139,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
