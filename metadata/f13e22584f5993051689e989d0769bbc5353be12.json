Over a decade ago, her heart was broken by a devastatingly beautiful woman--the woman she thought sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d spend the rest of her life with. Now, ten years later, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still trying to rebuild her life, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to think sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over the heartbreakÃ¢â‚¬â€more or less. \n\nBut Elizabeth and Heather, two of her oldest friends, are getting married. And they have a request. They want the old gang from college to take the Ã¢â‚¬Å“infamous road tripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that they talked about, all those years ago. Their not so secret goal is for Andee and her ex, Robin, to patch things up before the wedding where theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all be bridesmaids.\n\nAndee agrees, against every one of her better judgments. And the four best friends hop in a green convertible and begin the thousand-mile road trip that Andee isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite sure sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll survive.\n\nThat is, until she starts falling in love with Robin, all over again.\n\n&quot;Road Trip Reunion&quot; is the first romantic novella in &quot;The Thousand Mile Love Story&quot; series, about two women who reconnect, forgive and forget and love again; and the funny mishaps a thousand-mile road trip can bring. It is approximately 24,000 words long (several hours of reading or so).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13e22584f5993051689e989d0769bbc5353be12","amp;dn":"FF+Natalie+Vivien+-+Road+Trip+Reunion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13e22584f5993051689e989d0769bbc5353be12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,62,34,88,79,89,147,5,22,137,233,137,208,118,155,188,83,83,190,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
