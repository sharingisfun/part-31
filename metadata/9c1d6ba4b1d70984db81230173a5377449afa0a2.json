Rex gets a call that Providence is trying to transport a power core, when an E.V.O. goes on the loose, and conveniently, is near the power core. Rex later finds \nout that Van Kleiss used him as a decoy to detract attention from the power core. After a battle between Rex and Van Kleiss, the latter turns Noah into an E.V.O. (a giant blond E.V.O. dog), forcing Rex to try and cure him before Providence hurts his friend while chasing all over the city and into a sewer. \nDr. Holiday did research on a sample she took from the earlier E.V.O and reveals that the E.V.O.s created by Van Kleiss may become permanent, if not cured within a certain amount of time (she assumes, at this point, that the time period is different for each E.V.O.). Rex's biometrics drops, causing him to take a breather before curing Noah. Van Kleiss scares Noah away before Rex can cure him. After a chase in a labyrinth of train tracks, Rex's biometrics spike back up, and a new build of his allows him to defeat Van Kleiss, with a little help from Noah. After Rex finally cures his friend, it is revealed that turning Noah into an E.V.O. was actually a distraction as pulling out Rex, Six, and Bobo crippled the defenses of the power core, allowing Breach to steal it and recover Van Kleiss. Back at HQ, Rex is training, trying to create more builds (including a Water-Jet), after deciding that he wants to stay back &quot;home&quot; in Providence, with Six and Holiday feeling the same way. \n \n23 2 &quot;Waste Land&quot; Chris Graham Tad Stones February 11, 2011 693-023 \n\nFollowing an E.V.O. attack on a research ship, Rex and Six are called upon to retrieve the reactor core's rods of the ship. If not rescued, the rods would destroy the surrounding areas. During their underwater mission in the middle of the Pacific, both of them are attacked by E.V.O. fish, and discover a hidden underwater city carved out of the waste lands, an island twice the size of Texas made out of trash, called Aquania. It is a city of hundreds of E.V.O. fish species and is led by an E.V.O. named Surge (short for Sergio). Rex and Six find out that the research ship is in a sea trench, where the pressure will cause the reactor cores to explode and destroy Aquania. However, before they can inspect it, the lines holding the ship suddenly snap, sinking the ship down into the trench. Rex dives deep into the trench to retrieve the core and save Aquania and \nall its inhabitants. As he enters the ship, Rex finds the core reactors, but before he can grab them, his air supply runs out (his oxygen mask was damaged as he tried to enter the ship). Luckily, Surge rescues him and retrieves the core reactors. As they're about to leave, Six promises Surge that he nor Rex will reveal Aquania's existence and deletes all the pictures he had taken of Aquania. Rex brings with them a baby E.V.O. crab, as a &quot;souvenir&quot; for Holiday.  \n\n24 3 &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh Scott Sonneborn February 18, 2011 693-024 \n\nWhile fighting an E.V.O., Rex and Bobo hear of a party in the middle of a desert. Later, White Knight assigns them a mission at an underground event in the Sonoran Desert, with entertainment being provided by E.V.O.s. With civilians present, White Knight sends Rex, Bobo, and Kenwyn Jones, who has just graduated from Providence Academy as a lieutenant, undercover to observe the situation. Rex is annoyed by Kenwyn's by-the-book methods, while she dislikes his improvisational approach. During the party, Rex and Kenwyn run into Skwydd, who informs Rex of threats towards the performers. Later, Skwydd starts uncontrollably generating pure solid ink, entrapping both Rex and Kenwyn, then passes out. To keep the panicking partygoers from fleeing, Rex entertains them with his machine builds. Rex seeks leads from Thumb, a ball-shaped, three-headed, four-legged E.V.O., but both are shocked unconscious by Mouse, a humanoid-mouse-like E.V.O. Kenwyn evades the attack and knocks Mouse down. In the process, they find out that Mouse is not an E.V.O., but an older human woman. Mouse reveals that she despises the thought of humans and E.V.O.s working together, so she and her partner - ironically an anti-human E.V.O. - have been amplifying other E.V.O.s' capabilities to show how dangerous E.V.O.s can be. Her \npower-manipulating E.V.O. partner attempts to destroy the cave and kill everyone in attendance. Just as he's about to blow himself up, Skwydd uses his solid ink to encapsulate the E.V.O., protecting everyone from the blast. Back at Providence, Kenwyn reports to White Knight that the situation was brought under control by Rex, who did everything by the rules. White Knight assures them that he will team them up again, with Rex, Kenwyn and Bobo endorsing the idea.  \n\n25 4 &quot;Alliance&quot; Chris Graham Paul Giacoppo March 4, 2011 693-025 \n\nRex is sent on a mission to fix the Bug Jar shield. Van Kleiss comes to recruit the vengeful E.V.O, No-Face in the Bug Jar. When Rex finds out that the Pack is there along with Circe, he follows them wearing a stealth suit. He is discovered by Biowulf and Rex is saying how Biowulf is now becoming a henchman (as opposed to his previously right-hand man... wolf). Rex is knocked out by Circe after they have an argument. Rex is now taken into a stadium where he has to fight No-Face, very much to Circe's shock and horror. While fighting No-Face, Van Kleiss is saying, to a very shocked and horrified Circe, how they need Rex alive, but do not need him to have his brain working, although this angers No-Face who commands the E.V.O.s to attack the Pack. When Rex escapes and goes to the control shield room to find Bobo still holding on a lever (cause Rex said if he let go the machine would &quot;go boom&quot;), which he didn't need to anymore. The shield goes down and they both leave the room in the sewer and find Circe waiting for them and help them round up the E.V.O.s.When Circe, who finally sees Van Kleiss for what he truly is, uses her ultrasonic sound abilities to summon and lure all the E.V.O.s with her hypnotic siren-like melody. She soon becomes tired and has to rest for a bit while the spellbound E.V.O.s come toward them. When it seemed that they could not keep on going Biowulf comes and saves them and orders Rex to fix the shield generator. Rex fixes it and only has a minute to get out of reach of the shield. He transforms into his Rex Ride and tells Bobo to get on board with Circe, and asked if Biowulf was coming which he rejects with saying they tell no one he helped them. They barely made it out with the back of the bike broken off barely missing Bobo. Rex tells Circe that now she can make her own choices now that she doesn't need Van Kleiss any more. Bobo gives her a Providence bike to use, and Rex tells her that &quot;Hong Kong is nice this time of year&quot; (reference to Rabble). She still neglects to join Providence and goes off on her own, while Rex drives back to base, Bobo rubs it in that he still didn't get a date with Circe.  \n\n26 5 &quot;Robo Bobo &quot; Seung-Hyun Oh Man of Action March 11, 2011 693-026 \n\nAfter stopping another Rabbit E.V.O., Rex begins to suspect something is wrong with Bobo when he begins acting nice and even helping out around Providence. But when Rex tries to convince Six and Holiday, both tell him that he shouldn't worry, and Holiday even explains that Bobo had a troubled past involving a children's hospital and a man in a purple suit. Rex takes things into his own hands and throws a party, but when Bobo declines (and even escorts a showgirl called in by Rex), Rex attacks Bobo, knocking his head off in the process and discovering that &quot;Bobo&quot; is really a robot. The robot reveals a screen in its rear, displaying the real Bobo who explains to Rex that he needed some &quot;Bobo Time&quot;, and then requests that Rex not do anything to draw further suspicion on him or the robot. Rex however decides that the robot Bobo needs to be more like the real Bobo and uses his powers to change him. The noted aspect of Rex's changes is his saying 'good is bad, and bad is good', which the Robot Bobo begins to take quite literally. While studying the pink rabbit E.V.O. from earlier in the petting zoo, Holiday discovers it is pregnant and about to have babies. Unfortunately the mother rabbit spawns a lot of offspring, which begin to wreak havoc in the petting zoo. Rex, Holiday, and Six race to capture them but Robot Bobo, remembering Rex's saying, goes wild and attempts to release the native E.V.O.s, proclaiming it the &quot;ultimate prank&quot;. The real Bobo shows up in time before the E.V.O.s can escape and attacks Robo Bobo.Six and Holiday succeed in capturing the bunnies, while Rex battles the mother bunny which is acting very defensive around him. Six and Holiday get it to calm down and Bobo finishes off his robot double. When questioned by Six, Bobo quickly create an alibi about being kidnapped and replaced by the robot by the same man in a purple suit, and Six appears to buy it. Later on in Rex's room, Rex attempts to find out more about Bobo's past, who spins a similar tale like the one Holiday told him, about \nthe man in the suit and the hospital, and claims that he was visiting his family. But Rex is doubtful and begins to chase Bobo as the episode ends. \n \n27 6 &quot;Divided By Six&quot; Rick Morales David Slack March 18, 2011 693-027 \n\nOn his way home from fun and with a burger, Rex is ambushed by four humans, who are the 2nd-5th most dangerous men and women in the world. Six is revealed to actually be the sixth most dangerous mercenary, with Five, IV (Roman Numeral Four), Trey (a play on Trois, the French word for Three), and Dos (the Spanish word for Two) outranking him. They then reveal that they need Rex's help to heal their teacher - One. One turned E.V.O. five years ago, but had managed to remain somewhat aware through meditation and sheer willpower. On the deserted island where One resides, they enter a special containment vessel held over an active volcano, which is a fail-safe set to drop if One ever fails to enter a numerical password every forty one minutes. However, when it appears that One is too far gone and has become uncurable, Dos and the others decide to destroy him against Six's wishes. Rex tries to escape with One, but are cornered by the Four most dangerous. Rex attempts to fight back, but is nearly overwhelmed until Six arrives and helps out. Together, Six and Rex defeat the other mercenaries (with help from a new build). Afterward, Rex tries to heal One again, but is suddenly overcome with pain. When Six tries to stop Rex, fearing for his safety over his Master's, it turns out One has temporarily possessed Rex's mind and body, using him to speak to Six one last time. One expresses his admiration for Six choosing to help the world fight the E.V.O. threat, and then dies peacefully, his body dissolving and covering the island in lush green growth as a sign of his truly becoming &quot;one with everything&quot;. After being picked up by Providence, Six explains that he once wanted nothing more than to be the new One, but gave up on \nthat goal when he found Rex. Deciding he owes Rex a new hamburger, the two set out to get some food as they depart.  \n\n28 7 &quot;Mixed Signals&quot; Chris Graham Alexx Van Dyne March 25, 2011 693-028 \n\nWhile battling a starfish like E.V.O., Rex begins to have trance-like moments during the fight, with strange machines building from his body each time. Eventually he is dismissed from the fight on Six's orders, returning to one of the Providence outposts for a check up by Holiday. Deciding to let the trances go through, Rex builds a strange device that ensnares him, Holiday, and Bobo. Outside the outpost, a strange figure in a power suit appears and takes out the Providence soldiers with a strange frequency device and smoke grenades. The stranger releases Rex, and then removes his helmet, revealing himself to be CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar, Rex's long lost older brother. Rex agrees to leave with CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar, taking off in a mobile laboratory that takes them to the Artic in mere seconds.There, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar explains that during the Event five years ago, his pod lab's transportation system malfunctioned due to the force of explosion and caused him to leap forward five years into the future (though he claims in his time, it was fifteen minutes). However, both of their parents, Rafael and Violeta, were sadly killed in the explosion, very much to Rex's grief and sorrow. They then flee to Abysus after Providence tries to intercept them, where they are attacked by Van Kleiss and his E.V.O. followers. However, Six arrives in the Keep and they manage to escape, while Van Kleiss shows great concern at CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar's return. Back in the city with the Starfish E.V.O., Providence is having trouble containing the creature which has splintered into multiple, smaller copies (it was accidentally split in half by Rex during his earlier trances). However, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar injects the creature with a serum and causes it to reassemble into its complete form, which is then subdued by Providence. Back at Providence HQ, White Knight informs Six and Holiday that he wants CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar to remain, as his knowledge may prove useful. As CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar settles in, Rex confirms to Bobo and the others that while he is relieved to have found family again, he is still glad to have the others with him as well. \n \n29 8 &quot;Outpost&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh James Felder April 1, 2011 693-029 \n\nWhite Knight is alerted and assumes that the Green Fist organization are selling E.V.O.s to Van Kleiss, dispatching Rex and Bobo (who convinced White Knight to let him come along although Rex was intentionally meant as a &quot;solo&quot; run) to South America. Upon getting there Rex can immediately tell that the locals don't like them very much, he meets the head of the locale chapter of Providence named Agent Oso Martillo. Oso shows Rex around the base and introduces him to the E.V.O.s kept in the Kennel. Oso states that the smaller E.V.O.s are harmless and actually quite friendly, he'd let them go if it weren't bad for diplomatics, \nthe larger ones on the other hand, taking one that resembles a sabertooth cat as a example, are incredibly dangerous and are shipped to the Petting Zoo to be contained. After saving Oso from one the attacking E.V.O., he had just described he offers to buy Rex and Bobo a drink at the locale bar. When Rex discovers the nasty truth about the milk he spits out out on the local woman triggering a bar fight and resulting in Rex, Bobo, and Martillo getting thrown out. That night Rex sets up a trap for the Green Fist, using Bobo as bait they plan to lure them into the Kennel and capture them. They succeed but the E.V.O.s are turned loose in the process. Rex discovers that Valentina (who Rex accidentally spit milk on earlier) is the leader of the Green Fist, worst yet the E.V.O. Rex saved Oso from earlier is loose and infects two members of the Green Fist and Rex with a powerful poison.During interrogation, the Green Fist explains that they aren't working for anyone and are giving E.V.O.s freedom. Rex then talks to Dr. Holiday and learns that his nanites are slowing the effect of the E.V.O.s toxin, but it will eventually kill him and the other infected people. Dr. Holiday can synthesize an antidote if Rex can collect a sample of the E.V.O.'s DNA. alentina offers her services in capturing the E.V.O. she set free, since it's poison is also killing her men. Rex, Bobo and Valentina goes solo into the jungle to capture the E.V.O. after a long chase Rex lures the E.V.O. over a net trap and Valentina triggers it thus capturing the E.V.O. after Rex gets a DNA sample he attempts to cure the E.V.O. only to discover it's not a E.V.O. at all. Valentina suddenly realizes that it is the legendary El Chupacabra. Realizing this, Rex cuts it loose since it has been a part of the natural order longer then man, and lets Valentina &quot;get away&quot;. Back at the base, the two other infected members are \ncured of the Chupacabra's poison and are also set free. The next morning, Rex and Bobo leave South America and head home. \n \n30 9 &quot;Haunted&quot; Rick Morales Tad Stones April 8, 2011 693-030 \n\nRex, being aware of Noah's girl troubles, arranges a double date for Noah by seeing a scary movie with Annie and Claire. The plan goes awry when both of the girls cling to Rex and gets Noah mad. Rex goes to CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar to set up a haunted house to scare the girls with CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar's technology that rigs the scary parts of the haunted hotel through Rex's technopathic capabilities. At one point of Rex rigging a scare in the lobby of the hotel, the couch gets shredded, which isn't his doing. The group realizes that there is a ghost E.V.O. in the hotel and decides to use the magnet that CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar made to pull the E.V.O. together. The plan works but can still be intangible, so they use the chiller that CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar also made, to solidify the E.V.O. to be successfully cured by Rex to reveal that it was a black cat. Afterwards, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar shows up and the two girls cling onto him, angering Noah. The black cat humorously &quot;crosses&quot; Noah and Rex and is chased by them. \n \n31 10 &quot;Moonlighting&quot; Chris Graham Scott Sonneborn April 15, 2011 693-031 \n\nRex learns that two former Providence agents named Rombauer and Lansky are busting small E.V.O.s on Coney Island. During a battle with a Toad E.V.O., Rex goes to talk to the E.V.O. guys and helps battle the Toad E.V.O., which gets away. Rex discovers a weird goo that burns him when he touches it, then quickly turns into hard crystal. Rex decides to start working with them, if for nothing else then to get away from Providence for a little while, unfortunately Rex is so good at this job he completely overshadows the others. The Final Straw comes when Rex tries to go after the toad E.V.O. when the others are hired to deal with another E.V.O. Rombauer and Lansky move on while Rex fights the toad (who was creating the substance that Rex found earlier). Rombauer and Lansky ultimately decide to help Rex and are able to capture the Toad by shining their flashlight on it trapping it in its own crystal. Rombauer and Lansky make up with Rex and ultimately decides that they prefer taking out the less dangerous E.V.O.s of New York while Providence handles the more serious ones.  \n\n32 11 &quot;Without a Paddle&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh Ken Pontac April 22, 2011 693-032 \n\nNoah convinces Rex to enroll in his High School, Benjamin Franklin High, to compete in the Ping Pong tournament, Noah's three previous partners having been hospitalized in practice matches against a team from another school which Rex discovers is a pair of twins named Gabriel and Michael, who have turned E.V.O. and been fused together into a Two-Headed E.V.O. (with the right head being Gabriel and the and the left head being Michael). At the school, Rex is actually enjoying being around other kids who virtually worship Rex and Noah since they are on the Ping Pong team which they take way too seriously. Noah lies about Rex being a foreign exchange student from a school run by &quot;Principal Haha&quot;.Rex does surprisingly well on a Trigonometry Pop Quiz given by Mr. Buchiner which has a reputation to give even the Principal nightmares. During the tournament, the Twins father and Coach pushes them way too far, going so far as to use the same technology Mouse used in &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; on the twins causing them to grow four extra arms and go on a rampage. Rex deciding the well being of the audience and twins takes precedence over the tournament goes to fight and calm down the twins. During the fight, Rex and the twins smash into Mr. Buchiner's classroom, where he helps Rex by pointing out he can use the floorboards as a catapult, \nlaunching the twins back to the stadium. When Rex leaves Mr. Buchiner goes back to grading papers and talking about wanting a pony. Using their father as a distraction Rex is able to short out the amplifying patches returning the twins to their previously mutated state, unfortunately Rex informs the Twins that they're incurable.Rex chews out the coach for his reckless endangerment of his sons and both boys informs their father that they don't even like Ping Pong and would rather take piano lessons instead. With that the Coach decides to get them a piano teacher, enter them into a piano tournament, and make the lot of them proud. The principal however informs Rex for the destruction that Rex caused he's expelled. At Providence, Rex informs Dr. Holiday that he actually enjoyed his one week at school, which Dr. Holiday decides is a good thing since she believes she has been lenient in her tutoring of Rex making him also take History, Spanish, Trigonometry, and Science from her as well. The stylized epilogue shows that Noah's Principal met &quot;Principal Haha,&quot; Mr. Buchiner gets his pony, the Twins live out their dream as a piano player making their father proud, and Rex is still being put through Dr. Holiday's tutoring.  \n\n33 12 &quot;Written in Sand&quot; Chris Graham Man of Action April 29, 2011 693-033 \n\nWhile in the desert, Rex ends up investigating a nanite-free zone inside a sandstorm and notices Van Kleiss, Biowulf and Skalamander going into it. When Rex and Van Kleiss get stuck in a sink hole that leads to an underground cavern that is stealing the nanites from them. This forces Rex and Van Kleiss to form a temporary truce. It soon discovered that the center of the sandstorm is draining the nanites from all life and turning them into sand. Van Kleiss still claims that he knows about Rex's past and claims that CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar isn't the man he is to be, and that he started the Nanite Event. Soon, the two are attacked by rock monsters causing Rex and Van Kleiss to do the back to back method to fight the rock monsters. It is soon discovered that the hieroglyphics and valley are part of a system used by ZAG-RS in another plot to eliminate nanites. Van Kleiss stated that ZAG-RS was originally built as a Nanite Decontamination Unit to eliminate stray nanites by CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar. Van Kleiss states to Rex that the Omega-One Nanite in him can replicate his own nanites exponentially. As ZAG-RS transforms \nher programming into a giant robot, Rex ends up fighting ZAG-RS while Van Kleiss weakens ZAG-RS as the sandstorm dies down. Later on, CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar admits that ZAG-RS was his creation as they interrogate ZAG-RS. CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar reboots ZAG-RS, but Dr. Holiday notices that its memory has been wiped clean. CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar states that Van Kleiss must have initiated a program dump when he weakened ZAG-RS, while Rex wonders if what Van Kleiss said about his older brother was true. CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar reveals to Rex that ZAG-RS' voice is modeled after that of their deceased Mexican mother, Violeta, much to Rex's shock and grief. \n \n34 13 &quot;Night Falls&quot; Rick Morales Amy Wolfram September 16, 2011 693-034 \n\nRex and CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar go to a local village in Mexico to visit their adoptive grandmother, Abuela, but it turns out that she is hiding a dark secret and some werewolf-like E.V.O.s, who only transform at sunset. The mayor of the town ends up hiring Hunter Cain to deal with the E.V.O. problems. In the end hunter Cain has a battle with Rex, but is driven out by the wolfs. Then with the cure they find out from CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar, they make the village able to control the werewolf-like E.V.O. inside of them.  \n\n35 14 &quot;Hard Target&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh Paul Giacoppo September 23, 2011 693-035 \n\nUnder orders from Van Kleiss, Breach goes to Hong Kong as her master has an important mission for her, that involves an &quot;old friend&quot; of Rex. A panicked Rex follows her through her portal mistakenly thinking that Breach is after Circe and wants to take revenge on behalf of Van Kleiss and the Pack. However, it turns out that Breach is after none other than his former boss Quarry, who plans to get his revenge on Rex at all cost. Meanwhile Breach is heading to Quarry, Rex spends time with his friends from back then, thinking there all couples. Breach then goes to the prison and tells Quarry that Van Kleiss wants him to use a secret weapon to destroy rex. Rex then realizes Breach is trying to break out quarry and heads to the prison he's in. But by the time he reaches there, Quarry has escaped and betrayed breach to get the weapon for himself. Rex fights breach but she eventually escapes saying &quot;It's a disaster movie, for providence.&quot; Rex goes back to his buddies not knowing Breach followed him and kidnaps Circe. Rex, determined to save Circe, goes looking for her then finds Quarry destroying the \ncity With the ultimate weapon. Quarry tells Rex he's planning to sell the weapon to anyone who has money. Rex develops a new powerful shield and he uses it to defeat Quarry. Rex then makes a trade with Breach to give back Circe for a video he found from providence prison showing her telling Quarry everything about the weapon. Breach gives Circe back but Rex gives Quarry to Breach as a bonus to save her butt from Van Kleiss. It then ends with Rex leaving back to Providence.  \n\n36 15 &quot;A Family Holiday&quot; Rick Morales John Fang and Man of Action September 30, 2011 693-036 \n\nA cure for incurables is offered by Dr. Brandon Moses, and Dr. Holiday shows complete interest, although Six, Rex, and the White Knight grow suspicious. While trying to cure her younger sister, Beverly, Holiday ends up losing her to Moses, who takes her to be overpowered and sold. Six and Rex arrive from Moses labs, where they looked for clues, save Holiday, and explain that Moses was overpowering Nanites to make Evo's supercharged. The trio head to Moses' arctic labs to save Beverly. Moses escapes and Six almost loses his life to save both Holiday (whose name is revealed to be Rebecca), and Beverly. In the end, they cured Beverly and Rex go to the mall together, and Holiday and Six go on a date for the first time (off screen).  \n\n37 16 &quot;Exposed&quot; Chris Graham Charlotte Fullerton October 7, 2011 694-037 \n\nThe news crew from &quot;Ultimate Exposure&quot; is given a free all pass to Providence. Rex accidentally goes too far to get more time in the spotlight and on camera, resulting in dangerous consequences.  \n\n38 17 &quot;Grounded&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh James Felder October 14, 2011 694-038 \n\nWhile nearly all Providence staff have left for field training exercises, Rex is grounded (following an incident near where Dr. Rylander's lab used to be) and is forced to clean the Providence storage warehouse. Noah convinces him to host a party, but can only deliver four unpleasant schoolmates (Shades, McKelly, Dunky, and Beagle) as guests. Rex initially has difficulty entertaining the four, who refer to him as an E.V.O. freak, until he takes them to the shooting range, where they have fun shooting targets with Providence firearms. Meanwhile the Jungle Cat E.V.O. that had been petrified by Van Kleiss in &quot;Dark Passage&quot; reanimates in the warehouse and quickly takes down the remaining Providence guards. Rex locks-down HQ to stop the E.V.O. from escaping and drafts the guest to recapture it. Rex, Noah, and the hoodlums discover that the E.V.O. re-petrifies whenever the it gets distracted. During an intense fight, it emerges that the E.V.O. wants to escape in order to take revenge on Van Kleiss; Rex manages to convince him to join Providence.  \n\n39 18 &quot;Six Minus Six&quot; Chris Graham Alexx Van Dyne October 21, 2011 694-039 \n\nAn effort to restore Rex's memories results in Six losing most of his. Now having reverted to his earlier, less-refined self, Rex has to help Six find his way back from heartless mercenary to the mentor he has come to know. \n \n40 19 &quot;Lions and Lambs&quot; Seung-Hyun Oh Rob Hoegee November 4, 2011 694-040 \n\nBreach has her portal-creating abilities artificially enhanced by Van Kleiss, to the point where she can create golden-colored swirling portals through time itself. White Knight is being pressured by the Committee, the shadowy superiors of Providence, to stop this dangerous threat. Rex must try and convince Breach to come over to the good side willingly, a task at which he gradually makes progress. When Van Kleiss discovers the scheme, a rebellious Breach teleports \nthe away with Rex. A cat-and-mouse game ensues, as the Pack tracks her around the world. After White Knight loses patience, he personally leads an attempt to forcibly capture Breach. Rex then uses his much stronger technopathic abilities to give Breach total control of her newly acquired time-traveling abilities, which she uses to send Van Kleiss, Rex, and apprently herself, away through a bright golden-colored time portal. Rex wakes to find himself in the middle of an empty desert landscape. He calls for assistance on his communicator, and is relieved to reach Providence.
