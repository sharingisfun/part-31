It was originally serialised in the UK style magazine The Face, beginning in 1989, and collected as a graphic novel in 1992. In it a film-maker learns he is suffering from a terminal illness, and imagines a last film which he will never have time to make before he dies. The story examines the relationship between images of an imagined World Apocalypse and the experience of one man&amp;#039;s personal, individual apocalypse.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340832b060e64d519d800862d29d3a3c5abc2219","amp;dn":"Signal+to+Noise+%28Neil+Gaiman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340832b060e64d519d800862d29d3a3c5abc2219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,8,50,176,96,230,77,81,157,128,8,98,210,157,58,60,90,188,34,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
