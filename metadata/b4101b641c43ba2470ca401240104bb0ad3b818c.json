In this stunning series they revisit some of their favourite natural history moments from their global careers, and tell us how Scotland has helped them hone their specialist skills for capturing some of the greatest images to grace our television screens.\n\n\n1)  Ice \nNarrated by David Attenborough - the first episode of this stunning new series reveals the hardships and hazards involved when filming wildlife in the world's most extreme environments - the Arctic and Antarctic. Legendary polar cameraman and diver Doug Allan relives some of his most hair-raising encounters and returns to the place where his underwater career began - the freezing depths of a Highland river.\n\n2)  Land \nSome of the world's rarest and most dangerous animals live on dry land. Capturing them on film requires great patience and specialist skills. In this episode, Gordon Buchanan and Mark Smith reveal how the wildlife-tracking skills they learned back home in Scotland have allowed them to film some of the natural world's most intimate moments, including being the first to film wild pandas mating and snow leopards hunting.\n\n3)  Sky \nFilming the wildlife in our skies stretches the skills of any wildlife cameraman. Birds move in three dimensions and constantly change direction so keeping them in the frame and in focus is challenging. In the third episode of this illuminating series, Scots-based cameramen John Aitchison and close friend Mark Smith reveal some of the more unlikely corners of the world where they have filmed birdlife - from a rubbish dump in Dehli to a motorway flyover near Birmingham. The results are mesmerising.\n\n4)  Sea \nIn the last of this spectacular series on the work of the worlds top wildlife film-makers we enter the literally breathtaking environment of the ocean depths. Cameramen Doug Anderson and Doug Allan reveal the technical challenges of filming beneath the waves and encounter animals as diverse as blue whales, white-tip sharks and the unforgettably named weedy sea dragon - a tiny creature whose courtship dance is as tender and graceful as any ballet.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5180/pmm9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/5180/pmm9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1630/3gga.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1630/3gga.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/7348/vx1l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/7348/vx1l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/3057/fs85.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/3057/fs85.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/4351/0rq4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/4351/0rq4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/6329/jaqz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/6329/jaqz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/5261/a8xj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img441.imageshack.us/img441/5261/a8xj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5498/2feb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5498/2feb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5991/fg35.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/5991/fg35.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n * Technical Specs for SD\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1198 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 404\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part:29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: average 277 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xf5qt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xf5qt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4101b641c43ba2470ca401240104bb0ad3b818c","amp;dn":"BBC+Wild+Cameramen+at+Work+1of4+Ice+PDTV+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4101b641c43ba2470ca401240104bb0ad3b818c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,16,27,100,28,67,186,36,112,202,64,18,64,16,75,176,173,59,129,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
