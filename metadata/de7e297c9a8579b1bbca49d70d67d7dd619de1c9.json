M. Nikolsky. \n\nThe major part of this two-volume textbook stems from the\ncourse in mathematical analysis given by the author for many\nyears at the Moscow Physico-technical Institute.\n\nThe first volume consisting of eleven chapters includes an\nintroduction (Chapter 1)which treats offundamental notions of\nmathematical analysis using an intuitive concept ofa limit. With\nthe aid of visual interpretation and some considerations of a\nphysical character it establishes the relationship between the\nderivative and the integral and gives some elements of differentiation\nand integration techniques necessary to those readers\nwho are simultaneously studying physics.\n\nThe notion of a real number is interpreted in the first volume\n(Chapter 2) on the basis ofits representation as an infinite decimal.\nChapters 3-11 contain the following topics: Limit of Sequence,\nLimit of Function, Functions of One Variable, Functions\nof Several Variables, Indefinite Integral, Definite Integral,\nSome Applications of Integrals, Series.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by V. M. Volosov. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1977 with reprints in\n  1981, 1985 and 1987.
