The age commenced with Pushkin, developed with the fantastic and grotesque tales of Gogol', and grew to full flower with Dostoevsky and TolstoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who at the time were considered in Europe to be lesser writers than their talented contemporary Turgenev. As the 20th century approached, Chekhov's exquisitely understated plays and stories symbolized the sunset of the golden age.\n\nGorky straddled the next transformation, linking the turmoil preceding the Russian Revolution with the political oppression that affected all artists in the newly established Soviet Union from the 1920s on. You examine the brilliant revolutionary poet Maiakovsky; the novelist Sholokhov, who portrayed the revolution as a tragedy for the Cossack people; the satirist Zoshchenko, who used Soviet society as food for parody; and Pasternak, who produced beautiful poems and a single extraordinary novel. Your survey ends with Solzhenitsyn, who became the most influential literary voice speaking out against the tyranny of the Soviet system.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=2830&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=2830&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1033ba71b6d4dd835efba103483cbe216a31db51","amp;dn":"TTC+Classics+of+Russian+Literature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1033ba71b6d4dd835efba103483cbe216a31db51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,51,186,113,182,212,221,131,94,251,161,3,72,60,190,33,106,49,219,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
