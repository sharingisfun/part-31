Though FDR, the American aristocrat, and LaGuardia, the son of immigrants, are unlikely partners, together they expand and redefine the role of government in people's lives.\n\nVol. IV: We have a plan\nWhen world famous socialist author Upton Sinclair runs for governor of California, his platform provides an alternative to capitalism and tests the limits of the New Deal. Ironically, one year after Sinclair's defeat, President Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act, a move that signals the beginnings of a modern welfare state.\n\nVol. V: Mean Things Happening\nOn tenant farms of the Arkansas Delta and in the steel factories of America's industrial heartland, men and women battle landowners and factory managers for the right to join a union.\n\nVol. VI: To Be Somebody\nHard times bring fear, which often errupts in violence and discrimination towards America's racial and ethnic minorities. But hard times also encourage some to fight against bigotry through the courts, in Congress, and by example - the NAACP's Walter White, African American attorney Charles Houston, heavyweight champion Joe Louis, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nVol. VII: Arsenal of Democracy\nAs the 1930s draw to a close, Americans celebrate a dream of peace ans prosperity at World Fairs in San Francisco and New York. But with Japanese and German troops on the march, they soon discover that while the New Deal changed America forever, it is war, not government programs, that ends the Great Depression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f405a6112ac93d54cc760fa3b9c881af268ae59","amp;dn":"The+Great+Depression+-+Documentary+series+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f405a6112ac93d54cc760fa3b9c881af268ae59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,64,90,97,18,172,147,213,76,199,96,250,59,156,136,26,242,104,174,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
