You are unity. You are infinity. You are love/light, light/love. You are. This is the Law of One.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1983, contact was made to an extra terrestrial entity known as Ra using Tuned Trance Telepathy by a team of three people, Don Elkins, Jim McCarty, and the channel Carla Rueckert. The 106 sessions are recorded in a series of books known as The Ra Material, an humble messenger of The Law of One. The books describe the situation on earth and our evolution as a species into a higher dimension. RaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answers to questions are transcribed verbatim in a series of 5 books.\n\nThe great channel Edgar Cayce referred many times to the Ra material and the Law of One in his readings. During ancient times, Cayce was incarnated as Atlantean Priest Ra-Ta who delivered the message of Oneness and established temples in Egypt based on the Law of One. This period of leadership by Ra-Ta was a time of great enlightenment which influenced the entire world and ages that followed, including the present. The readings refer to it as, Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most momentous occasions or periods in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ We are at that time again now.\n\nRa is a 6th density social memory complex who represents the Confederation of Planets in love and light of the One Infinite Creator. Ra first made contact with earth 18,000 years ago during the time of Atlantis and again 11,000 years ago during the Egyptian time period. The attempts at contact were to offer service to earth beings in understanding the Law of One.\n\nThe Law of One states that all things are One, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. All are one means that we are all co-creators and that what we do to others, we do to ourselves. We need only look into the mirror to see the Creator and out to others to see ourselves. From this perspective, we can only love and provide a lifetime of service to others.\n\nRa explains that the Confederation of Planets is comprised of 53 civilizations consisting of 500 planetary consciousness complexes, all planetary entities from this solar system and other galaxies who are allied in service according to the Law of One. Further, the foundation for the understanding of the Law of One is the understanding of intelligent infinity. The Confederation appoints a council to guard the earth, which is the Council of Saturn from the 8th dimension. To put it into perspective, there are 67 million planets in this galaxy that have awareness and our Council of Saturn works with the planetary spheres of 7 of our galaxies.\n\nIn reality, there exist many dimensions in the universe. Our illusion of experience in the 3rd dimension preoccupies our thoughts even thou we can sense a bigger reality. Earth, previously in the 3rd density, is in the process of becoming a 4th density planet. Ra says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“During this planetary shift, the space/time of your solar system has enabled this planetary sphere to spiral into space/time of a different vibrational configuration. It is now in a space/time continuum, fourth density.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  In order for earth beings (souls) to continue to evolve on the 4th density, they must raise their energy to the vibration of Love and have an orientation of service to others.\n\nRa explains that there are 65 million Wanderers here on earth helping with the transition into the 4th density and states further that the Orion Group is a service to self group that has contacted many on the planet Earth who also serve themselves. This polarity on Earth is the key to free will and choice that we make in 3rd density, also known as the Density of Choice. As we enter 4th density, known as the Density of Love, our souls evolve to the vibration/frequency of the new Earth. Those incarnating now as the Indigo or Crystals are already tuned into the 4th density. The choice we are making now on earth will determine whether we individually evolve into the 4th density. Ra explains that they have made attempts to communicate the Law of One to our civilization in the past and that attempts have failed, but their mission continues to be of service to earth souls now at this important time.\n\nThe reason is that this is the time of Harvest. As explained by Ra,\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is going to be a Harvest, as you might call it, a harvest of souls that will shortly occur upon your planet. We are attempting to extract the greatest possible harvest from this planet. This is our mission, for we are the Harvesters. There is a choice to be made very shortly, and it would be preferable if all of the people of this planet understand the choice that is to be made. It will be difficult for many of the people of this planet to understand what this choice is, because it is a choice that they have not considered. They have been much too involved in their daily activities and their confusion and their desires of a very trivial nature to be concerned with an understanding of the choice that they are very shortly to make. Whether they wish to or not, whether they understand it or not, regardless of any influence, each and every one of the people who dwell upon planet Earth will shortly make a choice. There will be no middle area. There will be those who choose to follow the path of love and light and those who choose otherwise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn Carla RueckertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book, Living the Law of One 101:  The Choice, she explains the way out of uncertainty and chaos as we experience the shift and our old paradigms crumble. It is a light seekers guide to spiritual transformation abiding by the fundamental principles of human decency and dignity delivered by the Law of One.\n\nThru an open-minded look at the Ra material, we can grasp a broader understanding of the true history of the earth, our position in the universe as an evolving species on a planetary sphere that is helped by many other societies who have evolved as we are doing, and, most importantly, how we can grow spiritually during our time incarnated here on earth.\n\n[epub format]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lawofone.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lawofone.info&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12d1bd4164a596148eb589921b860455bffa5600","amp;dn":"The+Law+of+One+%28Ra+Material%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12d1bd4164a596148eb589921b860455bffa5600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,209,189,65,100,165,150,20,142,181,137,146,27,134,4,85,191,250,86,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
