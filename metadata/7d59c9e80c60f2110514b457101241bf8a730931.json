Probably some guttural growls, wobbly frequencies and all manner of sludgy nastiness. One producer who makes twisted and intricate little figurines out of the same toolset is San Francisco's Eprom. His previous EPs saw him deftly explore a hybrid between hyperactive crunk and spastic dubstep, overstuffed with bouncy basslines that tumbled drunkenly like the screwiest of hip-hop. He emerges with his debut album, Metahuman, on Dutch grime(ish) label Rwina Records, which finds him transforming almost instantly from an occasionally-intriguing producer to one with a striking command of style and sound design. \n\n\nMetahuman has three dominant sounds: foundation-shaking sub-bass, chirpy chiptune synths and silence. Through all of Metahuman, Eprom is constructing a stunningly inventive world where go-for-broke &quot;rave&quot; music doesn't have to sacrifice ingenuity or detail. There are a lot of moments that might test the taste barriers of stodgier dance music fans, but for every one of those there's an enthralling bit of texture or layering behind it. It's rare to hear artists hang in limbo so expertly, the much-neglected purgatory between &quot;tear-out&quot; and &quot;stay-in.&quot; On Metahuman Eprom takes the entirety of his local San Francisco bass sceneÃ¢â‚¬â€encompassing dubstep, hip-hop, drum &amp; bass and god knows what elseÃ¢â‚¬â€and makes a mutant out of it. \n\n\nDon't forget to seed, and if you enjoyed the album, support the artist by buying the album here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/metahuman/id536088220\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d59c9e80c60f2110514b457101241bf8a730931","amp;dn":"Eprom%3A+Metahuman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d59c9e80c60f2110514b457101241bf8a730931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,89,201,232,12,96,242,17,5,20,180,87,16,18,65,191,138,115,9,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
