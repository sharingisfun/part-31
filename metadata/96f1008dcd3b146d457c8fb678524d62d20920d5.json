Maandig's presence isn't incidental; having her as the focal point shifts the tone considerably, giving the music a dreamy quality even when things get quite gnarled and ugly, as they do on &quot;Parasite.&quot; Draped in twisted, processed guitar gunk, &quot;Parasite&quot; is recognizably Reznor's, as is the electro-throb of &quot;Fur Lined,&quot; and the ominous undertow of &quot;BBB,&quot; but HTDA's debut EP doesn't consist of dressed-up leftovers from &quot;The Slip&quot;: some of Reznor's obsessions remain recognizable, but having collaborators opens up the music and Maandig softens it, giving this EP a different feel despite some familiar sounds.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f1008dcd3b146d457c8fb678524d62d20920d5","amp;dn":"How+To+Destroy+Angels+-+EP+%28FLAC%2C+mp3%2C+and+Hi-Def+Video%29+%282010%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f1008dcd3b146d457c8fb678524d62d20920d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,241,0,141,205,59,20,109,69,124,143,182,120,82,77,98,210,9,32,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
