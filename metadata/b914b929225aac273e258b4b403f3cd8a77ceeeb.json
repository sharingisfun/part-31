Ritland started his own company training and supplying dogs for the SEAL teams, U.S. Government, and Department of Defense. He knew that fewer than 1 percent of all working dogs had what it takes to contribute to the success of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite combat units, and began searching the globe for animals who fit this specific profile. These specialized canines had to pass rigorous selection tests before their serious training could begin.\n\n The results were a revelation: highly trained working dogs capable of handling both detection and apprehension work in the most extreme environments and the tensest of battlefield conditions. Though fiercely aggressive and athletic, these dogs develop a close bond with the handlers they work side by side with and the other team members. Truly integrating themselves into their units, these K9 warriors are much like their human counterpartsÃ¢â‚¬â€unwavering in their devotion to duty, strong enough and tough enough to take it to the enemy through pain, injury, or fear.\n\n For the first time ever, Trident K9 Warriors gives readers an inside look at these elite caninesÃ¢â‚¬â€who they are, how they are trained, and the extreme missions they undertake saving countless lives, asking for little in the way of reward. From detecting explosives to eliminating the bad guys, these powerful dogs are also some of the smartest and most highly skilled working animals on the planet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b914b929225aac273e258b4b403f3cd8a77ceeeb","amp;dn":"Trident+K9+Warriors%3A+My+Tale+from+the+Training+Ground+to+the+Bat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b914b929225aac273e258b4b403f3cd8a77ceeeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,20,185,41,34,90,172,39,62,37,139,75,64,63,60,216,167,124,238,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
