All at once dirty, sexy, and lethal, &quot;The Boto Machine Gun&quot; is inspired by soul, Hawaiian, dub, hip-hop, and the Jamaican soundclash scene\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBuy it if you like it, support good music! Attend shows!!\n\nPlease Comment,\n\n-Karlsbad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53c515b71b2684da4cecf7c7e5b6cc4f7b4fe47","amp;dn":"Sabatoge+Sound+System+-+The+Boto+Machine+Gun+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53c515b71b2684da4cecf7c7e5b6cc4f7b4fe47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,60,81,91,113,178,104,77,164,206,207,124,126,91,108,196,247,180,254,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
