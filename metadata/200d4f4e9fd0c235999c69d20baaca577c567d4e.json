His views dominate the series even after his passing, on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the passage of the United States Declaration of Independence. As a result of his achievements during the revolution, and afterwards as vice president and president, subsequent Adams generations have a hard time dealing with this legacy of public service and accomplishment and frequently wonder if they are measuring up to their distinguished ancestry. In the end, the members of the fourth generation feel that the time in which the Adams family can play a prominent role in the affairs of the nation has passed.\n\n\nThis series was released on DVD by Acorn Media on May 13, 2008.\n\n\nChapter I: John Adams, Lawyer\nChapter II: John Adams, Revolutionary\nChapter III: John Adams, Diplomat\nJohn Adams and his temperament find little diplomatic success in France, where Franklin is widely appreciated. However Adams negotiates a large loan in the Netherlands. John Quincy Adams is dispatched to Russia as a diplomat's secretary due to his great facility for languages. Adams concludes the Treaty of Paris.\nChapter IV: John Adams, Minister to Great Britain\nChapter V: John Adams, Vice President\nWith Gen. Washington as President, Adams becomes Vice-President and head of the Senate. When Jefferson's Republicans and Hamilton's Federalists have strongly conflicting views over the French Revolutionary war, Adams finds himself in the middle. Adams is elected second President of the United States.\nChapter VI: John Adams, President\nIncreasingly exasperating relations with France lead to the XYZ Affair, then the Quasi-War.\nChapter VII: John Quincy Adams, Diplomat\nIn Ghent, Adams and his delegation struggle to negotiate an end to the War of 1812.\nChapter VIII: John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State\nDuring the Seminole War, the executions of Arbuthnot and Ambrister in Spanish Florida create a diplomatic incident. The United States and Britain consider whether to make a joint statement on the wars in South America, but this evolves into the Monroe Doctrine. In the presidential election, Henry Clay is the kingmaker. Adams becomes sixth President.\nChapter IX: John Quincy Adams, President\nChapter X: John Quincy Adams, Congressman\nChapter XI: Charles Francis Adams, Minister to Great Britain\nChapter XII: Henry Adams, Historian\nChapter XIII: Charles Francis Adams II, Industrialist\n\n\nCast\n\nAdams family\nGeorge Grizzard as John Adams (Chapters IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“VI, VIIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IX)\nKathryn Walker as Abigail Adams (Chapters IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV)\nLeora Dana as Abigail Adams (Chapters VÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“VI, VIII)\nAddison Powell as The Reverend Smith (father of Abigail Adams) (Chapter I)\nNancy Marchand as Mrs. Smith (mother of Abigail Adams) (Chapters IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“II)\nJ.
