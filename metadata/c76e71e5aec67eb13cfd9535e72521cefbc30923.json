An improvisation by all players over this pattern follows.\n\n&quot;The Fourth Movement&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is in traditional song form with drums, violin, bass guitar and bass pedals. The piece concludes with added synthesizer environments of modulated noise and alpha brain wave control of an ARP 2500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320 KBPS\n\nCover Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\n\nFM is a Canadian progressive rock music group formed in 1976 in Toronto. The band existed from 1976 to 1996, with a brief return in 2006, although they had a period of inactivity between 1989 and 1994. Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes.
