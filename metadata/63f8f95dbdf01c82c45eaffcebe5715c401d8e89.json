But as an overall listen, Brainbloodvolume trumps Are You Normal? as an exciting, involving release brimming with energy and a willingness to experiment while retaining the yearning heart that informed so many of the group's early classics. It's a pity the album was absolutely lost upon release -- in a severe irony, it was released in the U.S. well before it surfaced in the U.K., and even then couldn't compete against the tidal wave of Brit-pop driving all before it. The absolutely massive guitar blast and partially sampled metallic percussion that drives opening track &quot;All I Ask of Myself Is That I Hold Together,&quot; with John Penney's always-reliable vocals riding the chaos with increasing desperation, serves notice that the quintet isn't into doing anything half-assed. Other instances of the band's ear for newer approaches can readily be heard in &quot;Floote&quot; (which, besides including the titular instrument, adds an attractive sitar filigree for a trippily fierce crunch) and the epic but not overbearing collapse of &quot;Your Only Joke&quot; and &quot;I Want It Over.&quot; Some moves are obvious -- the sped-up &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; loop at the heart of the tender &quot;Premonition&quot; can't help but being clichÃƒÂ©d through over-use, though the combination of acoustic guitar and a quietly hyperactive keyboard techno riff makes up for it. Guitarist Rat really steps to the fore at many points, with he and on occasion Alex Griffin indulging in crisper, sometimes-abstract performances that suggest early-'80s post-punk ÃƒÂ  la New Order and the Cure. The combination of heavily processed wash and gentler chime on &quot;...To Be Right&quot; really stands out, as does John Penney's fine vocal turn, suiting the song wonderfully. (4/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f8f95dbdf01c82c45eaffcebe5715c401d8e89","amp;dn":"Ned%27s+Atomic+Dustbin+-+Brainbloodvolume+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f8f95dbdf01c82c45eaffcebe5715c401d8e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,248,249,93,189,240,28,130,196,94,175,252,235,229,113,92,64,29,142,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
