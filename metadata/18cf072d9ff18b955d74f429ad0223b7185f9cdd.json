Steve Tilston is one of the UK's finest acoustic singer-songwriters and a consummate guitarist. For some it would be a huge artistic risk to approach a whole album of &quot;different&quot; material but Steve is able to cross musical genres with skill and deftness - the trademark of someone who knows his craft well. Great integrity and artistry is evident here in his treatment of a carefully-chosen selection of traditional folk songs. The delivery and accompanying arrangements make this an album accessible to all - you don't have to be a traditional folk fan to like folk and this is the kind of quality and wow-factor that can make the difference for the &quot;I'm-waiting-to-be-convinced&quot; doubter. And while you're thinking about it you ought to check out Steve's other albums for a good helping of the best in English acoustic singer-songwriters, that shamefully overlooked but once-discovered, never-forgotten species. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/steve-tilston/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18cf072d9ff18b955d74f429ad0223b7185f9cdd","amp;dn":"Steve+Tilston...Of+Many+Hands%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18cf072d9ff18b955d74f429ad0223b7185f9cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,207,7,45,159,241,139,149,93,116,244,41,173,2,35,183,24,95,156,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
