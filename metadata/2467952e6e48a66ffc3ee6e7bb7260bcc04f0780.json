The album has been released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2013, before issuing in Canada on April 22 and the United States on April 23. The album was preceded by the release of the lead single, the original composition &quot;It's a Beautiful Day&quot;, released on February 25, 2013. The album features four original songs and ten cover versions.\n&quot;To Be Loved&quot; was commissioned by Michael's record label after the success of his fifth studio album, and seasonal record, Christmas, which became the second biggest selling album of 2011, selling more than seven million copies worldwide. The album was entirely produced by Bob Rock, and was recorded in Vancouver, Canada and Los Angeles. The album includes ten standards, and four original songs all co-written by BublÃƒÂ©, three with long time collaborators Bob Rock, Alan Chang and Amy Foster-Gillies. &quot;After All&quot;, one of the four original tracks, was written by Alan Chang, Steven Sater and Jim Vallance, and co-performed with Bryan Adams. The album also features appearances from actress Reese Witherspoon on &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot;, Naturally 7 and The Puppini Sisters, and includes covers of songs such as the Bee Gees' &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, Dean Martin's &quot;Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)&quot;, the Miracles' &quot;Who's Lovin' You&quot;, Jackie Wilson's &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, and Scotty Wiseman's &quot;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?&quot;\nIn an interview posted on his official website, BublÃƒÂ© stated: &quot;My new record is about love, happiness, fun and yummy things. Getting to work with my friend and longtime collaborator Bob Rock, who was also responsible for &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;, &quot;Crazy Love&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot;, and produced the entire album, was very exciting. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a good team. I love the songs we selected this time out. It was also terrific working once again with my songwriting partners&quot;. BublÃƒÂ© is scheduled to perform ten dates at LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s O2 Arena from June 30, 2013 in promotion of the album.\n&quot;It's a Beautiful Day&quot; was released as the album's lead single on February 25, 2013. Short audio clips of the track were posted to BublÃƒÂ©'s official YouTube account, before the full track was released via iTunes. A music video for the track premiered February 28, 2013. As of July 3, 2013, the album has sold 528,000 copies in the US.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] You Make Me Feel So Young\n[02] It's A Beautiful Day\n[03] To Love Somebody\n[04] Who's Lovin' You\n[05] Something Stupid - Featuring Reese Witherspoon\n[06] Come Dance With Me\n[07] Close Your Eyes\n[08] After All - Featuring Bryan Adams\n[09] Have I Told You Lately That I Love You - With Naturally 7\n[10] To Be Loved\n[11] You've Got A Friend In Me\n[12] Nevertheless (I'm In Love With You) - Featuring The Puppini Sisters\n[13] I Got It Easy\n[14] Young At Heart\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:46m:16s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 117mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
