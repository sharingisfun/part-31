It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, and co-produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are the World. Following Band Aid's &quot;Do They Know It's Christmas?&quot; project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist Harry Belafonte, who, along with fundraiser Ken Kragen, was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. Following several months of working together, the duo completed the writing of &quot;We Are the World&quot; one night before the song's first recording session, in early 1985. The last recording session for the song was held on February 28, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most famous artists in the music industry at the time.\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010 in Hollywood, California. It was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record will aid survivors of the impoverished country.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea355eabd8106fa6f28078ce9addb3791f6e1ad","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+We+Are+The+World+25+For+Haiti+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea355eabd8106fa6f28078ce9addb3791f6e1ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,163,85,234,189,129,6,250,111,40,7,140,233,173,219,55,145,246,225,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
