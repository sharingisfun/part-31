The movie, available on DVD December 20, is a follow-up to Joss Whedon's much-loved but short-lived Firefly series, which was broadcast on Fox in 2002. Buy Serenity on DVD and support the underdogs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f9ecad9a4545bde852af1e096df55f52cf75ab","amp;dn":"The+Complete+River+Tam+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f9ecad9a4545bde852af1e096df55f52cf75ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,249,236,173,154,69,69,189,232,82,175,30,9,109,245,95,82,207,117,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
