When she ends up on a ski lift next to handsome local college boy, Dax Windsor, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thrilled; but Dax takes everything from SidÃ¢â‚¬â€including a lock of her perfect red curlsÃ¢â‚¬â€and she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember any of it.\n\nBack home and unable to relate to her old friends, Sid drops her college prep classes and takes up residence in the A/V room with only Corey Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Living StonerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Livingston for company. But as she gets to know Corey (slacker, baker, total dreamboat), Sid finds someone who truly makes her happy. Now, if she can just shake the nightmares and those few extra pounds, everything will be perfect... or so she thinks.\n\nWitty and poignant, Colleen ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning debut is a story about moving on after the unthinkable happens.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cd546542d1f7031eb403f3df210f5ae6b409e5","amp;dn":"What+Happens+Next+by+Colleen+Clayton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cd546542d1f7031eb403f3df210f5ae6b409e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,205,84,101,66,209,247,3,30,180,3,243,223,33,15,90,230,180,9,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
