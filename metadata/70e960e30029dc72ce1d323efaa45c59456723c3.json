Reaching #6 on the Billboard 200 and #5 on the UK Album Chart, Sheryl Crow has sold 2.9 million units in the US as of January 2008 and is certified 3x platinum. As of February 2008, it has sold 880,344 copies in the UK. The song &quot;Love Is a Good Thing&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;Watch out sister, watch out brother, watch our children while they kill each other with a gun they bought at Wal-Mart discount stores&quot; (in criticism of Wal-Mart's gun sales policy). For this reason, sales of the album were banned at Wal-Mart stores. &quot;Redemption Day&quot; was covered by Johnny Cash on his second posthumous record, American VI: Ain't No Grave. Sheryl Crow is featured in Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums list by Slant Magazine. Entertainment Weekly magazine placed the album at number 39 in their list of Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Matthew Parks (DURHAM, NC USA) - After years in the business as a backup singer for a number of big name pop and rock acts, Sheryl Crow hit it big with Tuesday Night Music Club, an album chocked full of catchy, well-crafted, radio-orientated pop tunes. Nothing on that album, though, really hinted at what lay in store for 1996's self-titled album. Crow had become one of those very few artists who has been both lucky and brave with her career. Her years as a backing vocalist had made her industry savvy, and the big success of her debut album gave her enough industry clout that she could assume creative control of her subsequent albums. In addition to singing and writing or co-writing all of the songs on the album, Crow also produced and plays guitar, bass, and Hammond organ on the disc. She brings to this album, a bigger, noisier, more rock n' roll sound to complement a more accomplished, edgier collection of songs. The guitar sound is somewhere between the Stones of Exile on Mainstreet and early Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Crow's voice is less studio- produced sounding than it was on her previous record, moving from a sweet soul/R&amp;B sound on &quot;Everyday is a Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; to a harsher, harder-edged, almost Janis Joplin-like buzz on &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Morning.&quot; &quot;Maybe Angels,&quot; &quot;A Change,&quot; &quot;Sweet Rosalyn,&quot; &quot;Everyday is a Winding Road,&quot; &quot;Love is a Good Thing,&quot; and &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; round out a great record.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Maybe Angels\n[02] A Change Would Do You Good\n[03] Home\n[04] Sweet Rosalyn\n[05] If It Makes You Happy\n[06] Redemption Day\n[07] Hard To Make A Stand\n[08] Everyday Is A Winding Road\n[09] Love Is A Good Thing\n[10] Oh Marie\n[11] Superstar\n[12] The Book\n[13] Ordinary Morning\n[14] Free Man\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:59m:59s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 371mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 24 September 1996\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow\n&gt;\n&gt;[Everyday Is A Winding Road]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e960e30029dc72ce1d323efaa45c59456723c3","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Sheryl+Crow+-+Sheryl+Crow+371mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e960e30029dc72ce1d323efaa45c59456723c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,233,96,227,0,41,220,114,206,29,50,62,250,164,92,89,69,103,35,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
