All mods are freeware/public domain so require no hacks/patches or crack files. The quality of game play varies from Fantastic to Meh.\n- These games require the original HalfLife2 game to be installed. \n- Installation methods vary between mods. Some are packaged as auto installers, others are zipfiles that just need to be decompressed to your mods folder. \n- Most come with instructions for installing.\n- Feel free to download only the ones you want, or the whole sha-bang.\n\nIf you know of other single player Half-Life mods that are worth playing, please let me know.\n\n\nPlease seed to 5:1 ratio or better\n\nComments and ratings welcome, but not required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23986da9e0b08ddf0afd880417edfe8bd63b5f5","amp;dn":"Half+Life+2+Mods+-+Single+Player","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23986da9e0b08ddf0afd880417edfe8bd63b5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,57,134,218,158,11,8,221,240,175,216,128,65,126,223,232,189,99,181,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
