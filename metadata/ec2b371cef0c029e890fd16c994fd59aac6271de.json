She&amp;#039;s like a Tom Waits-y female avante-garde pop machine. She never got the credit she was due. \n\n\n&quot;A performer whose enigmatic and experimental work reflected the strong influence of Biblical mysticism and Middle Eastern musical textures, Danielle Dax was born in Southend, England.\nUpon the Lemon Kittens&amp;#039;s 1982 split, Blake formed the Shock-Headed Peters, while Dax mounted a solo career. She debuted a year later with Pop-Eyes, a true solo effort for which she wrote and performed every song alone, even handling mixing and production duties and distributing the record through her own Awesome label. After reuniting with Karl Blake, Dax returned in 1984 with the Jesus Egg That Wept EP, which also featured the first appearance of guitarist/keyboardist David Knight, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2b371cef0c029e890fd16c994fd59aac6271de","amp;dn":"Danielle+Dax-+The+Jesus+Egg+That+Wept","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2b371cef0c029e890fd16c994fd59aac6271de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,43,55,28,239,12,2,158,137,15,209,108,153,79,213,154,172,98,113,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
