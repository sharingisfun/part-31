The moves feature elements from ballet, Pilates, Callanetics and the Lotte Berk Method - short pulses, precise body positions and lots of between-routine stretches. Each 10-minute segment uses just one exercise; it's a format that forces you to really internalize the movement's subtleties and benefits. But there's lot of variety - within each section you're constantly varying the angles, tempos and range of motions.\n \nQuality : DVDRip \nFormat : AVI \nVideo codec : XviD \nVideo : Codec: XviD; Bitrate: 498,75 kbit / s; Frame Size : 672x368; fps 29 fps \nAudio : Codec: MPEG1 Layer-3, bitrate: 128 kb / s \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf376ae094ece59dfcc9507284b53c664a2ada6b","amp;dn":"Exhale%3A+Core+Fusion+Thighs+and+Glutes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf376ae094ece59dfcc9507284b53c664a2ada6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,55,106,224,148,236,229,157,252,201,80,114,132,181,60,102,74,42,218,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
