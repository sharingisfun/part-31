Points for ambition, but ultimately, this is their least consistent effort since This Is the Modern World. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Weller, before forming the Style Council and eventually going on to a solo career, was the singer/songwriter/guitarist for this influential mod/punk trio that was enormously successful in their native England but never really hit it off in the States. As their albums progressed, Weller began moving the band further away from straight punk and into more R&amp;B-flavored territory. Here are the ultimate fruits of that transformation.\n\nAlong with the influence of Motown (&quot;Town Called Malice&quot;), this album also includes tasteful nods to disco (&quot;Precious&quot;), along with a more mod/punk call to their ealier days (&quot;Just Who Is the Five O'Clock Hero&quot;), an interesting instrumental track (&quot;Circus)&quot; and catchy numbers like &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;Ghosts.&quot; Further evidence of experimentation is evident on the dancey &quot;Trans-Global Express&quot; and the use of steel drums on &quot;Planner's Dream Gone Wrong.&quot;\n\nUnfortunately, Weller disbanded the group soon afterwards, but in a way it's a good thing -- quitting at their peak was the classiest thing these guys could have done.
