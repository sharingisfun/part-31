One of the group has a bomb.\nThe film's events follow the group's attempts to escape (with racism, greed and revenge including some bloodbath lol) playing key elements as they all fight to survive.\n\nBad ratings at imdb are ridiculous. All actors including the little girl perform perfectly well.\nSarcastic humor is a mark of higher intelligence, majority of folks just didn't get it. Those who never visit theatres may not enjoy it.\nThose unsatisfied relying on poorly translated subtitles shouldn't blame the movie but the translators.\nNot a second I (and some friends) got bored during the whole movie. Get high if you can before watching lol.\nIf you're into a too serious mood postpone it for &quot;better times&quot;.\n\nSource-------- US BD AVC @29MBps  (superior to Ger BD AVC @20MBps)\nReleased------ 2014/06/05\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 5.2 GB\nLength-------- 1:24:48\nVideo Bit rate ~7.1 MBps\nResolution---- 1920/816 (2.35:1)\nFrame rate---- 23.976 fps\nAudio--------- ENG DTS 5.1 @1536\nSubtitles----- Eng, Dan, Fre, Ger, Ind, Rom, Rus, Spa\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a786ed2244cd8d10a24b3c1e6b2415a5abd0797","amp;dn":"Elevator+2011+US+BDRip+1080p+x264+DTS+5.1+multisub-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a786ed2244cd8d10a24b3c1e6b2415a5abd0797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,120,110,210,36,76,216,209,10,36,179,193,230,178,65,90,90,189,7,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
