Now recovering from his injuries but tortured by nightmares he tries to stay on the periphery and persuade Rosie (Ruth Negga) to come home from London. When John Boy pays off a large debt, Darren yet again finds himself trapped and back under John Boy's control.\n\nStill spooked by the death of his brother Hughie, John Boy's drug habit is making him increasingly paranoid and erratic. Nidge, now John Boy's second in command and principle enforcer, is trying to juggle an always tricky personal and professional life. Trish is about to have a baby and Nidge must try to maintain peace as John Boy becomes progressively volatile. When a consignment of drugs is impounded by customs, it sparks a war with a rival gang leader Fran. As the crisis escalates, John Boy becomes unpredictable and dangerous; loyal to no-one including members of his own gang.\n\n\nIN THIS EPISODE\nAs Nidge struggles to maintain good terms with Dano, his web of lies and excuses threatens to unravel at Siobhan's fancy dress twenty-first birthday party. Reeling from her trauma, Siobhan confides in her friend Donna Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ but Donna is a gossip and it's only a matter of time before the secret gets out. \n\nWritten by Stuart Carolan.\n\n\nCAST\nRobert Sheehan     ...
