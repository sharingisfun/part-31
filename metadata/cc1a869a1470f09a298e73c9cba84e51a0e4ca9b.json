The film is based on a play by Harry Brown and stars Bonar Colleano, Arthur Franz and Lee Marvin. \n\nSometimes it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take an extensive set, a large all-star cast, or even much action to speak of to create a stellar piece of war movie history. Eight Iron Men pits, well, eight men against their own wits, a German machine gun nest, and their superiors when one of their own gets pinned down.\n\nReally Eight Iron Men is more character story than war story, and in that respect it absolutely shines. The entire picture deals with the moral dilemma of the plight of their downed comrade. Should they go against orders and try to rescue him? Do they simply leave him as their patrol moves out? Is he still alive at all?\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 945mb\nDuration.... 01:20:32\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 3048kbps\nFrame Rate.... 29F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1a869a1470f09a298e73c9cba84e51a0e4ca9b","amp;dn":"Eight+Iron+Men+1952+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1a869a1470f09a298e73c9cba84e51a0e4ca9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,26,134,154,20,112,240,154,41,142,115,201,203,168,78,81,160,228,202,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
