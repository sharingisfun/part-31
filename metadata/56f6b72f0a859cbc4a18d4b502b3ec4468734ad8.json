Pallett has also said that the album is a reflection on how atheists confront death.[4]\n\nThe track &quot;This Lamb Sells Condos&quot; refers to Toronto real estate developer Brad J. Lamb, who had previously used the song's title phrase as an advertising slogan. In the song, Pallett imagines an argument between the eponymous developer and his wife that alludes heavily to various fashion designers.\n\nThe album cover art is by Robin Fry.\n\nThe album was named the winner of the 2006 Polaris Music Prize on September 18, 2006.\n[edit] Track listing\n\nEight of the ten songs on He Poos Clouds are directly related to the eight schools of magic in the tabletop game Dungeons &amp; Dragons.[5] The school of magic correlating to the song is in parentheses.[6]\n\n    &quot;The Arctic Circle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 (Abjuration)\n    &quot;He Poos Clouds&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 (Illusion)\n    &quot;This Lamb Sells Condos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39 (Conjuration)\n    &quot;If I Were a Carp&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 (Necromancy)\n    &quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:57\n    &quot;I'm Afraid of Japan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 (Enchantment)\n    &quot;Song Song Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 (Evocation)\n    &quot;Many Lives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ 49 MP&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56 (Divination)\n    &quot;Do You Love?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03 (Transmutation)\n    &quot;The Pooka Sings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f6b72f0a859cbc4a18d4b502b3ec4468734ad8","amp;dn":"Owen+Pallet+--+He+Poos+Clouds+--+Perfect+Metadata","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f6b72f0a859cbc4a18d4b502b3ec4468734ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,246,183,47,10,133,156,188,74,24,212,181,2,179,236,68,104,115,74,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
