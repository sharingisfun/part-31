Special packaging includes a 28-page booklet featuring previously unseen and rare photos, and newly-written liner notes by Warren Zanes. The collectionÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s 19 tracks have been digitally remastered by Giles Martin at EMIÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s Abbey Road Studios. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison is a gathering of material that takes us far into the territory that was\nultimately a place unique to George Harrison,&quot;writes Warren Zanes in his liner notes essay for the new collection.\n\nThis collection is the first to span HarrisonÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s entire solo recording career, including the #1 Billboard Pop singles &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Isn't It A Pity,&quot; &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth),&quot; and &quot;Got My Mind Set On You.&quot; Let It Roll also features live recordings of three timeless Harrison-penned Beatles songs, &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes The Sun,&quot; from his 1971 all-star Concert For Bangladesh benefit at Madison Square\nGarden.\n\n&quot;The keyhole into the world of George Harrison is the music itself. Yet his songs and the accomplishments for which heÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s remembered are inextricably bound and those accomplishments are, without question, eclectic in scope,&quot; Zanes writes.\n\nGeorge Harrison is a twice-inducted member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a solo artist and as a member of The Beatles, and an 11-time Grammy Award winner for his recordings with The Beatles, Traveling Wilburys, and as a solo artist.\n\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Got my mind set on you                               [03:53]\n02.Give me love (give me peace on earth)                [03:35]\n03.Ballad of sir frankie crisp (let it roll)            [03:49]\n04.My sweet lord                                        [04:41]\n05.While my guitar gently weeps (live version)          [04:47]\n06.All things must pass                                 [03:47]\n07.Any road                                             [03:52]\n08.This is love                                         [03:48]\n09.All those years ago                                  [03:46]\n10.Marwa blues                                          [03:41]\n11.What is life                                         [04:25]\n12.Rising sun                                           [05:27]\n13.When we was fab                                      [03:52]\n14.Something (live version)                             [03:10]\n15.Blow away                                            [03:59]\n16.Cheer down                                           [04:06]\n17.Here comes the sun (live version)                    [02:55]\n18.I don't want to do it                                [02:55]\n19.Isn't it A pity                                      [07:08]\n____\n\n77:36 min\n114,8 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00da65f39419340554a800b04353a204b0ef4d5","amp;dn":"George_Harrison-Let_It_Roll-%28Retail%29-2009-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00da65f39419340554a800b04353a204b0ef4d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,13,166,95,57,65,147,64,85,74,128,11,4,53,58,32,75,14,244,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
