Appropriate to its title, The Rising Tide comes in sweeps and swells, ranging from searching, uncompromising rock like &quot;Killed By an Angel&quot; and &quot;One&quot; to gentle, beautiful ballads like &quot;Rain Song&quot; and even pop-tinged songs like &quot;Television,&quot; which sounds a bit like a more propulsive version of the Police's early '80s singles. Though the album was recorded with a trio lineup (Jeremy Enigk, Dan Hoerner, and William Goldsmith), it's some of the band's fullest-sounding work, rich with strings and keyboard flourishes that add extra depth to the shimmering, Eastern-inspired drones of &quot;Fool in the Photograph&quot; and &quot;Faces in Disguise.&quot; Lou Giordano's production gives The Rising Tide an unabashedly big, clean sound that frames Sunny Day's detailed songwriting and arrangements perfectly, giving the restrained, reflective &quot;Tearing in My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Ocean&quot; as much impact as driven tracks like &quot;Snibe&quot; and &quot;Disappear.&quot; Best of all is the title track, which blends a beautiful melody, heartfelt vocals, and an insistent rhythm into a sweeping, affecting finale. Expansive and complex without compromising the band's focused, impassioned style, The Rising Tide is one of Sunny Day Real Estate's -- and 2000's -- most impressive albums. \n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 2000\nLabel: Time Bomb\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Alternative\nQuality FLAC\nAllmusic rating 4.5 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;Killed by an Angel&quot;       4:55\n   2. &quot;One&quot;                      4:09\n   3. &quot;Rain Song&quot;                4:03\n   4. &quot;Disappear&quot;                4:09\n   5. &quot;Snibe&quot;                    4:29\n   6. &quot;The Ocean&quot;                4:50\n   7. &quot;Fool in the Photograph&quot;   4:09\n   8. &quot;Tearing in My Heart&quot;      5:07\n   9. &quot;Television&quot;               4:31\n  10. &quot;Faces in Disguise&quot;        6:02\n  11. &quot;The Rising Tide&quot;          5:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bc629c8cc242c0fb50ac961efbb17fa36d18b8","amp;dn":"Sunny+Day+Real+Estate+-+The+Rising+Tide+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bc629c8cc242c0fb50ac961efbb17fa36d18b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,188,98,156,140,194,66,192,251,80,172,150,30,251,177,127,163,109,24,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
