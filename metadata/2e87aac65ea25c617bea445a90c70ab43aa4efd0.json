Join the club of Farmville Masters!\n\nNeed more reasons to fall in love with this application? keep reading...  \n\nIn this game, the best way to level up and get money is to be constantly planting and harvesting seeds. In fact, the best way to level up is to plant seeds that get ready in a very short time, so that you can get all the experience points very quickly.\n\nHowever, every time your seeds are ready, the same boring and repetitive tasks have to be accomplished. This involves picking up every fruit, plowing the terrain and planting seeds again. When you start evolving in this game, so does your farm, and you will find yourself expanding it early from the beginning. The average number of arable squares in a player's farm is between 300 and 400. After a while, clicking 1200 times in the screen (400*3) every time your seeds are ready starts to be just too much. If you consider you also have to click in every animal and tree from time to time, the situation is even worse! Even with new addictions such as the tractor and the harvester, you still only plant 4 squares at a time and are highly dependable on fuel, which can only be bought with the special notes.\n\n- What can you do to avoid making 1200 clicks every time your seeds are ready?\n\n- How can you plant 2-hour seeds before going to work or to sleep without them dying before you can pick them up?\n\n- How can you go away for some days and make sure your farm is being harvested and your animals and trees are being collected?\n\nFarming Extreme Manager was made to attend these issues, allowing you to harvest, plow and plant all your farm terrain, collect from your animals and harvest your trees with just one click. In fact, since this application actually knows how much time a certain seed takes to get ready, it can start the process again as soon as the seeds are ready, with no human intervention at all. And it will do this indefinetely for as long as you want. It is even clever enough to dismiss every box that happen to show up (like a friend asking for help, a conquered ribbon or a level passed) and continue the work!\n\nThis means you can tell the application to plant 2-hour seeds before you go to bed and after your 8-hour sleep, you will see that you have grown 4 entire crops of those seeds, climbing your experience points to a much higher level as well as your money.\n\nBesides, the application also helps you accomplish the Ribbons/Tasks. For example, the ribbon &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; requires you (in the latest level) to help your neighbours 2500 times. This is just incredibly not reasonable and if you would do it manually, it would require hundreds of hours from your time doing highly boring work. However, Farming Extreme Manager does this all automatically for you, allowing you to go have a coffee and come back just to found you helped your friends and fertilized their farms hundreds of times, thus being closer to the ribbon, having more money and more experience.\n\n\nHow to Use Guide:\n=================\nFarming Extreme Manager 3 is very easy to use.\n\nOptions and Parameters:\n------------------------\nAs you can see, there are two groups: One for the main feature of harvesting your farm, animals and trees, and another for extra features (helping neighbors and the level-up-trick). You only need to tell the application what you want to do by checking the various checkboxes (harvest,plow,plant, collect from animals, harvest trees).\n\nThe first time you use the application, you need to define your planting areas. This is very easy to do! You just need to click on &quot;add/edit planting areas&quot; and you will be told to open farmville in full screen. When you do so, your farm is going to be replicated on the screen so you can define your planting areas. Notice that next time you edit your planting areas, you won't need to open farmville as the application will already have an image of your farm.\n \nNow, in the edit planting areas window, you just need to define what and where you want to plant. On the left side, you see that there is a list of all the planting areas you have. You can add new ones by pressing the &quot;add&quot; button, or delete them by double-clicking on them. To select the seed of a specific planting area, you just need to choose it from the list on the right. If for some reason you don't want the harvest of that area to start right away, you can define a delay (for example, if that area is not ready to be harvest yet).\n \nFor each planting area, you must click in every crop that should be harvested. However, you don't need to actually click on every square, you can define areas by clicking in one square and then, while holding the shift key, click on another square. Notice that you may also undo and redo your operations by pressing the keys &quot;z&quot; and &quot;y&quot; respectively. If you click in a color dot, you will delete it if you have selected the same planting area or, if you have selected another one, you will change the color of the dot. If you want to delete a whole planting area, just double click on it (inside the listbox on the topleft corner)\n\n \nFinally, when you've finished, you can click on the finish button, and on the main window, click on the harvest button. Then, you only need to open your farmville game in fullscreen, and that's it, the application will harvest,plow and plant in the planting areas you defined and, if you requested it, collect from your animals and trees.\n\n\nHelping Neighbours:\n--------------------\nHelping neighbours and fertilize their farms is something you can do for three reasons: Getting ribbons, money and experience.\n\nHowever, the process is absolutely repetitive and boring if you want to win ribbons or gain any considerable amount of money or experience. The last ribbon, for example, requires you to help your neighbours 2500 times... Imagine doing that on your own! With Farming Extreme Manager, you can do it automatically.\n\nIt's very easy to use, you don't need to set up any option, you just have to open Farmville in the neighbors area and hit the &quot;Help Friends&quot; button. Please notice that when you press the &quot;help friends&quot; button, the manager will minimize and the farmville game must be the active application.\n\nAnd that's it! Just go for a walk and when you come back you will be closer to the ribbons and have acquired an interesting amount of money and experience. Not to mention your friends will be glad you fertilized their farms!\n\nNice, ah?\n\n\nQuick Level-Up:\n----------------\nThe second edition of Farming Extreme Manager comes with an incredible trick to quickly level-up in Farmville. Basically, it consists in a change of money for experience. If you have a big quantity of money and would like to &quot;buy&quot; experience, you can plow terrain, plant soybeans (or any other seed) to gain experience. Then, instead of waiting for it to harvest, you delete the terrain and do everything again. You lose some money but win experience at a very fast rate.\n\nTo use this feature, you just need to type how many columns you want to plant and how many times you want to repeat the process. Then, just press the &quot;super fast level-up button&quot; button, open farmville in full screen and put your mouse over an empty area (empty green square inside your farm). Notice that if you have bought Hawaiian Potatoes, you can choose to use them as they give you more experience.\n\nAnd that's it! Just go for a walk and when you come back you will have much more experience than before. With this feature, you can gain up to 80 thousand experience points per day\n\nNice, ah?\n\n\nSuggestions and Remarks:\n--------------------------\nThis last section of the Farming Extreme Manager user guide will address some minor issues that were not refered in the other sections, as well as give suggestions on how to improve your farmVille experience.\n\nLock your Farmer - There is one technique you should be aware of before you start harvesting your farm. You should always lock your farmer before the process of harvesting,plowing and planting. By locking I mean trapping him between fences or objects so he can't actually move to the arable terrain. You can, for example, put him inside the cows area and then close the area with fences before starting to harvest. Or you can trap him between 8 hay bales. Notice that every time you log in your farmer shows up in the middle of the farm so you have to do this everytime you login. To avoid this, you can trap him in the center square.\n\nThis way, every time you log in to farmville, the farmer will be trapped and you don't need to do anything else.\n\nYou may be wondering, why the heck should I do this? Well, first of all, it cuts the harvesting time to half: Since you don't have to wait for the farmer to move from square to square, it's much quicker. Besides, when using the Farming Extreme Manager, it's very important to lock the farmer, because if you don't, the application might accidentally click over him while trying to click on an arable square if he walks through the trajectory of the clickings in the wrong time.\n\nFull-Screen and Zoom-Out - Don't forget that FarmVille must be running on full-screen mode and having the zoom-out in the maximum.\n\n\nTutorials:\n-------------------------\nHarvesting, Plowing and Planting:\n\nHelping your Neighbours:\n\nLevelUp Trick:\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Torrent Request: ChattChitto(AT)ChattChitto(DOT)com\n[Put The Request Name In The SUBJECT Box &amp; Also Provide It's Webpage, Or Your Request Will Be Ignored Automatically]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e87aac65ea25c617bea445a90c70ab43aa4efd0","amp;dn":"Farming+Extreme+Manager+3.35+FarmVille+%2B+Crack+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e87aac65ea25c617bea445a90c70ab43aa4efd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,135,170,198,94,162,92,97,123,234,68,90,144,199,10,180,58,164,239,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
