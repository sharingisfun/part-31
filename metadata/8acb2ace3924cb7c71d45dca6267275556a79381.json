Within there is a utility to create standalone CDs of such.\nNo Serial Required, This Edition will fully update itself from the Windows Update website without any problems whatsoever. If you can get used to classic start menu and themes again, This OS Runs much faster with more stability, and is more streamlined than xp. It still costs more than xp to purchase.\nOn occasion installing an application will demand XP, In such rare cases, look for a slightly older version of the application and install it first, then update it.\nHave a CD ready with your VGA, Sound Card, Ethernet and other drivers and a windows media player 9 install, as well as an Internet Explorer 6 Install. Before you connect to the internet, Install a Software firewall and block &quot;Services and Controller App&quot; when it asks.\nDiscover the true potential of your PC with no bloated crap backdoor XP services :-)\nalso search for the Unofficial Service Pack 5 torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8acb2ace3924cb7c71d45dca6267275556a79381","amp;dn":"Windows+2000+sp4+4in1+MultiBoot+ULTIMATE+WGA+CRACK+no+serial+FAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8acb2ace3924cb7c71d45dca6267275556a79381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,203,42,206,57,36,203,124,113,212,93,202,98,103,39,85,86,167,147,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
