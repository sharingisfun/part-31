It is the stuff of the towering Captain Cook and his wide-ranging network of exploring voyages, Robert Louis Stevenson and Admiral Halsey. It is the place of Paul Gauguin and the explosion of the largest-ever American atomic bomb, on Bikini atoll, in 1951. It has an astonishing recent past, an uncertain present and a hugely important future.\r\n\r\nThe ocean and its peoples are the new lifeblood, fizz and thrill of America â€“ which draws so many of its minds and so much of its manners from the sea â€“ while the inexorable rise of the ancient center of the world, China, is a fixating fascination. The presence of rogue states â€“ North Korea most notoriously today â€“ suggest that the focus of the responsible world is shifting away from the conventional post-war obsessions with Europe and the Middle East, and towards a new set of urgencies. Navigating the newly evolving patterns of commerce and trade, the worldâ€™s most violent weather and the fascinating histories, problems and potentials of the many Pacific states, Simon Winchesterâ€™s thrilling journey is a grand depiction of the future ocean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:405726557ec1c63868ffca6b8d07e91f5579f28a","amp;dn":"Pacific+-+The+Ocean+of+the+Future+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"405726557ec1c63868ffca6b8d07e91f5579f28a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,87,38,85,126,193,198,56,104,255,202,107,141,7,233,31,85,121,242,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
