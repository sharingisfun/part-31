In the last decade of his career, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu became involved in a series of high-profile political interventions, defending the cause of striking students and workers, speaking out in the name of illegal immigrants, the homeless, and the unemployed, challenging the incursion of the market into the field of artistic and intellectual production. \n\nThis new study presents the first sustained critical analysis of the political implications of Bourdieu's sociology. Through a close reading of the political speeches and pronouncements of his later years, Jeremy F. Lane provides a detailed exposition both of Bourdieu's critique of neo-liberalism and of his own political position. Bourdieu's theory of politics is also brought into critical dialogue with the work of a range of other commentators of a broadly Marxist or post-Marxist orientation who have also intervened in such debates - theorists such as Stuart Hall, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, Judith Butler, Slavoj Zizek and Jacques RanciÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨re. \n\nThe first sustained analysis of Bourdieu's politics - this study will seek to assess the validity of his claims as to the distinctiveness and superiority of his own field theory as a tool of political analysis. It will be of great use to students, and researchers in sociology, social theory; cultural studies, French studies and political science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6e615d71ddb814747a252bc0a6e2ec52f67216","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2006%5D+Bourdieu%5C%27s+Politics+Problems+and+Possiblities+%28Rou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6e615d71ddb814747a252bc0a6e2ec52f67216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,110,97,93,113,221,184,20,116,122,37,43,192,166,226,236,82,246,114,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
