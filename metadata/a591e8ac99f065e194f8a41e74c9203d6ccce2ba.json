But this time there is a mixture of emotions running through each person. The patriarch of the family (Jacques Godin) suffers from a combination of Parkinson's Disease and heart failure. His life reduced in every way, the end approaches and there are unhappy memories of his once violent and authoritarian past. But his wife, ten children and many grandchildren try to maintain a semblance of the Christmas season. Conversations quickly turn around the health and care of the father, but also the devoted mother who, day by day, exhausted and worn down shrinks a little more. AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, the eldest son has never loved his father, and with reason as we learn through flashbacks. Yet even he is shocked by the by the downfall of his once all-powerful father.
