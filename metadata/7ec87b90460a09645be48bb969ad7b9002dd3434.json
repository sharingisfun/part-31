The second album released after Dick Dale's post-PULP FICTION career rehabilitation, 1996's CALLING UP SPIRITS takes up where 1994's UNKNOWN TERRITORY had left off, blending elements of world music and R&amp;B into the surf-guitar style that Dale almost single-handedly invented. As the title and cover art suggest, there's a level of spirituality in this music that you don't normally associate with instrumental surf.
