It is based on the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade. Because of its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, the movie was extremely controversial upon its release, and remains banned in several countries to this day. It was Pasolini's last film; he was murdered shortly before SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² was released. \nThe film focuses on four wealthy, corrupted fascist libertines in 1944 Mussolini's Italy who kidnap a total of eighteen teenage boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, sexual and mental torture before finally executing them one by one. The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality, and fascism. \nAlthough it remains a controversial film to this day, it has been praised by various film historians and critics, and while not typically considered a horror film, SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² was named the 65th scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77bcf18358bfdea0384c4d70525c37b417dcf49b","amp;dn":"Salo+o+le+120+giornate+di+Sodoma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77bcf18358bfdea0384c4d70525c37b417dcf49b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,188,241,131,88,191,222,160,56,76,77,112,82,92,55,180,23,220,244,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
