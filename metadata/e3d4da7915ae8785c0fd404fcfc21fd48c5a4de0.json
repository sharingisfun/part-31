It allows the upper body to become buoyant while opening the heart and increasing strength.\n\nCultivate the power and fluidity of these mythical creatures and enjoy feeling lighthearted once class is over. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start yoga class on your back with a rolled-up towel placed underneath the mid to upper back. The idea is to open the back in preparation for practice.\n\nJoin Lauren on this hour-long journey and enjoy challenging yourself with Mermaid Pose! See if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flex and stretch your way to a better body and a stronger mind.\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Hips, Flexibility, Backbends, Heart Opening, Shoulders\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d4da7915ae8785c0fd404fcfc21fd48c5a4de0","amp;dn":"Lauren+Eckstrom+Yoga+-+Mermaid+60+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d4da7915ae8785c0fd404fcfc21fd48c5a4de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,212,218,121,21,174,135,133,192,253,64,79,207,194,31,212,140,90,77,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
