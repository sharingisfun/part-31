However some take some time, such as the final track an instrumental, Ghostly horses of the plain, which is now one of my favourites. There are a few I don't like still, or at least are not as good. Overall despite its electronic sounds that doesn't always work with Als music, this is one for 80s fans and serios fans of Al. If you don't like 80s , and prefer the more sedate Al in Year of the cat, time passages etc then you may not like this, but you may like both as I do.\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/17/al-stewart/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/17/al-stewart/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18089b0e0cc49263d70289bb7f68cf0204f128ec","amp;dn":"Al+Stewart...Last+Days+of+the+Century%281988%29bonus+track%281997%29%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18089b0e0cc49263d70289bb7f68cf0204f128ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,8,155,14,12,196,146,99,215,2,137,187,127,104,207,2,4,241,40,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
