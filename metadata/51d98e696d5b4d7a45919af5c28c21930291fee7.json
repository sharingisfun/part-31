Who slammed a meteorite? And was it a meteorite? One version of a cartoon movie. Personally, I've seen that hung about the explosion in the sky. The sky hung subject. The truth while he took out the camera disappeared. And the sun that day was not normal. People have removed photos, no trace of the meteorite, weighing next three points. But all the stories about the meteorite many, many are not interested. For everyone to understand and feel the need to be heard three or four explosions in Chelyabinsk. Half the people do not understand think that could be a disaster, and more Herosimy Chernobyl.\n\nThe site details.
