About his brother, who is in a coma after being wounded in Iraq; about his best friend, Stuart, who is behaving like a jerk; about the old biology specimens in jars lining the walls of his classroom; and about Abigail, the new girl who seems to be a magnet for trouble. Or perhaps she is the cause.\n\nSuddenly TimothyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nightmares are coming true. His brother, his face decaying, approaches Timothy on the street. Stuart ends up in the hospital, terrified that monsters are stalking him. And the specimen jars are tormenting not only Timothy but his teacher as well.\n\nWhat is the secret in AbigailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past that is the key to these horrors? And can Timothy figure it out before his nightmares become a deadly reality?\n\nA follow-up to the well-received Stone Child, Dan PoblockiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second novel will have his readers mesmerized until the last pageÃ¢â‚¬â€and sleeping with the lights on.\n\nepub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d4d885624665a37eb9c4eb3ee1ca106d47d5127","amp;dn":"The+Nightmarys+By+Dan+Poblocki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d4d885624665a37eb9c4eb3ee1ca106d47d5127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,77,136,86,36,102,90,55,235,156,78,179,238,28,161,6,212,125,81,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
