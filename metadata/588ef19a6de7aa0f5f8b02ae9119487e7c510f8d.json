He worked for a time as a soldier before entering the Discalced Carmelite Prior in Paris. Lawrence was uneducated, and so had to enter the monastery as a layman. He worked in the kitchens and as a cobbler there for the remainder of his life. Lawrence is known for his devotion and ability to bring God into every aspect of his life. His classic Christian work, Practice of the Presence of God, details how to gain that constant and comforting connection to God. Readers have treasured this short and easy book for centuries because of Lawrence's honest advice and his obvious passion for spiritual matters. He rejoiced in everyday tasks, prayed constantly, and was known around the monastery for his kindness and willingness to help others. Practice of the Presence of God is a creative Christian work that is required reading according to many believers. Readers will come away with great peace and joy, and a better understanding of what it means to constantly be in God's presence.\n\nJohn Piper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Desiring God\nScripture reveals that the great business of life is to glorify God by enjoying Him forever. In this paradigm-shattering classic, newly revised and expanded, John Piper reveals that the debate between duty and delight doesn't truly exist: Delight is our duty. Readers will embark on a dramatically different and joyful experience of their faith.\n\nFrancis Chan - Crazy Love Overwhelmed by a Relentless God (Unabridged)\nThere are many voices critiquing the North American church today. The voices come from both within and without; from those who love the church and those who hate it. We all know that there is something wrong. But what? In many cases the prescription is the same while the cure varies widely. In his new book Crazy Love, first-time author Francis Chan, pastor of Cornerstone Church in Simi Valley, California, regular speaker at Passion conferences and other events, and the guy who recorded that &quot;Just Stop and Think&quot; evangelistic video where he walks for miles holding a surfboard, takes his opportunity to challenge the church. &quot;This book,&quot; he says, &quot;is written for those who want more Jesus. It is for those who are bored with what American Christianity offers. It is for those who don't want to plateau, who would rather die before their convictions do.&quot; It is a book that is meant to change the way Christians live their lives.\n\nHenry Cloud and John Townsend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boundaries\nIn order to call themselves good Christians, many people have drawn overly flexible boundaries (unwilling to say no, always accommodating others' needs) or overly rigid boundaries (to the point of being righteous and judgmental). Psychologists and inspirational speakers Cloud and Townsend show readers how to set reasonable boundaries in order to follow the true path of Christianity. This book has become immensely popular, most likely because it makes personal boundaries easier to define and is filled with spiritual purpose. Some cautions: the format can be overly self-helpish for such a complex discussion and the authors at one point imply that judicious spankings may be an acceptable form of setting boundaries with children. However, many Christians will probably find themselves grateful for this biblical context of boundaries.\n\nMax Lucado - God Came Near\nGod came near. He came not as a flash of light or as an unapproachable conqueror, but as One whose first cries were heard by a peasant girl and a sleepy carpenter. The hands that held him were not manicured, but callused and dirty.\nNo silk. No ivory. No hype. No party. No hoopla. God had come near ... for you.\nTravel back in time and relive Christ the Son of God becoming man. Come with Max as he brings to life the most important event in history ... when God came near. And as you catch a vision of this incredible moment, let it mark the beginning of a new life for yourself.\n\nC.S. Lewis - Mere Christianity\nMere Christianity is a revision of a series of radio lectures that C.S. Lewis gave during World War II.  It is a qualitative argument justifying the reasonableness, correctness, and implications of Christianity, beginning with observations of the world that have nothing to do with Christianity.  It is an argument for Christianity from the ground up, as it were.  Although quite different in style and in the arguments used, Mere Christianity is reminiscent of a modern version of the book of Romans.\n\nLewis begins by observing that there seems to be a universal morality among all people.  Although different cultures have varying ideas of what specific things are moral and immoral (for example, one wife or four, but never any woman you want), they all agree that things like selfishness are bad.  We also see this standard when someone breaks their promise to us:  we may feel that it is wrong to break our promises, but we feel hurt when someone does it to us.  This morality that we unconsciously expect is what Lewis calls the Moral Law.\n\nMike Yaconelli - Messy Spirituality \nI Guess I'm Not a Very Good Christian . . . Do you feel like: I don't pray enough I don't read my Bible enough I don't share my faith enough I don't love God enough I'm not committed enough I'm not spiritual enough Then this book is for you. Messy Spirituality was written for the silent majority of us who have been convinced that we just don't do Christianity right. We spend most of our lives worried about what we don't do instead of what we have done, focused on our imperfections instead of God's fondness for the imperfect. Why? Because we've been bombarded with books, tapes, talks, seminars, and movies convincing us that real Christianity is all about perfection. Michael Yaconelli dares to suggest that imperfection, infiniteness, and messiness are, in fact, the earmarks of true Christianity; that real Christianity is messy, erratic, lopsided . . . and gloriously liberating. What if genuine faith begins with admitting we will never have our act completely together? Maybe messy disciples are exactly the kind of imperfect people Jesus came to earth for and whose company he actually enjoyed--and still enjoys. If you want to find Jesus today, look for him in the midst of burned-out believers, moral misfits, religious incompetents . . . men and women whose lives are, well, messy. Messy Spirituality is a strong antidote for the spiritual perfectionism in us all. Here are truths that can cut you loose from the tyranny of ought-to's and open your eyes to the deep spirituality of being loved, shortcomings and all, by the God who meets you and transforms you in the midst of a messy and unpredictable life.\n\nRob Bell - Velvet Elvis\nVelvet Elvis? What kind of title is that for a book? More to the point, what kind of book has a title like that? I'm no Elvis fan (there goes my street cred then) and I'd never heard of Rob Bell, so to say I was sceptical when I picked it up is putting it mildly Ã¢â‚¬â€ but the publisher's rep had been raving about it. OK, I thought: give it a go. \nHe was right. I was wrong Ã¢â‚¬â€ never more so. Roger, I'm in your debt (again). Mind blowing, stunning, revolutionary: words like these barely begin to say it. If you're a Christian, you need to read this book. And when you do, you'll either be sucked in or blown out, probably thrown out if you're a hardliner who changes your attitude after reading it. One thing you won't be is indifferent. Your church leaders ain't gonna like this stuff. \nIf you're an ex-Christian, someone who's been driven away from church and faith by all the lies and hypocrisy and the church's history of violence, if you're a complete outsider who simply can't handle the idea of believing twelve impossible things before breakfast: this book is for you, too Ã¢â‚¬â€ if you can hack it. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588ef19a6de7aa0f5f8b02ae9119487e7c510f8d","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+Series+2+%28+bible%2C+gospel%2C+Cristian+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588ef19a6de7aa0f5f8b02ae9119487e7c510f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,142,241,154,109,231,170,15,95,139,2,174,145,25,72,126,124,81,15,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
