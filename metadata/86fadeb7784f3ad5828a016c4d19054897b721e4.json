Meanwhile Eliza canâ€™t wait to escape Seattleâ€”and her reputationâ€”and perfect-on-paper Anita wonders if admission to Princeton is worth the price of abandoning her real dreams. Andy, for his part, doesnâ€™t understand all the fuss about college and careerâ€”the future can wait.\r\n\r\nOr can it? Because it turns out the future is hurtling through space with the potential to wipe out life on Earth. As these four seniorsâ€”along with the rest of the planetâ€”wait to see what damage an asteroid will cause, they must abandon all thoughts of the future and decide how theyâ€™re going to spend what remains of the present.\r\n\r\n** PLEASE SEED **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86fadeb7784f3ad5828a016c4d19054897b721e4","amp;dn":"We+All+Looked+Up+-+Tommy+Wallach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86fadeb7784f3ad5828a016c4d19054897b721e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,250,222,183,120,79,58,213,130,138,1,108,77,25,5,72,151,183,33,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
