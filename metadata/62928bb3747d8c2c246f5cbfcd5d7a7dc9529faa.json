The record was completely performed by O'Connor with the help of some friends like Klaatu's Dee Long at ESP Studios and engineer Brian Bell. This album also produced three singles: &quot;Get It While You Can&quot;, &quot;Call Of The Wild&quot; and the Top-40 hit/video &quot;Shades Of '45&quot;.\n\nIt wasn't long before other artists came knocking looking for O'Connor's songwriting talents. The list includes .38 Special (&quot;One Time For Old Times&quot;, &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot;, &quot;Just A Little Love&quot;), Molly Hatchet (&quot;What's It Gonna Take&quot;), and Eddie Money (&quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;).\n\nO'Connor also wrote two movie themes: &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; featured in 'Thunder Alley' and performed by Leif Garrett, and &quot;Jungle Out There&quot; from 'Zoo Gang'.\n\nIn recent years O'Connor has been writing material in Nashville for Lace and Tia McGraff, and for Canadians such as Kim Stockwood, Jamie Warren, Beverly Mahood and Chris Aris.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62928bb3747d8c2c246f5cbfcd5d7a7dc9529faa","amp;dn":"Gary+O%5C%27+-+Strange+Behavior+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62928bb3747d8c2c246f5cbfcd5d7a7dc9529faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,146,139,179,116,125,140,44,36,111,92,191,205,93,122,125,201,82,159,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
