Gone here are the tinny sound quality and horror-flick-based lyrics of prior releases, replaced by clearer sonics and an often hilarious obsession with sex (examples of the latter can be found on &quot;What's Inside a Girl?,&quot; &quot;The Hot Pearl Snatch,&quot; &quot;Cornfed Dames,&quot; &quot;(Hot Pool of) Womanneed,&quot; &quot;How Far Can Too Far Go?,&quot; and the uproarious single &quot;Can Your Pussy Do the Dog?&quot;). There are numerous sly references in the verses to high and low cultural icons, including &quot;Shake it one time for me&quot; (a line from Jerry Lee Lewis' &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot;), &quot;I'll be dancing through the flames/Like a devil in disguise&quot; (a nod to the Elvis Presley hit), and &quot;Now there's more things in Tennessee/Than is dreamed of in your philosophy&quot; (a paraphrase of a line from Shakespeare's Hamlet). Most of the songs here are in various rockabilly-derived styles featuring either garage rock fuzz or Duane Eddy twanging guitar from Poison Ivy. Vocalist Lux Interior is in excellent form here, exhibiting a fair bit of variety within his usual 1950s-derived approach. &quot;Kizmiaz&quot; is unique in the band's oeuvre, being a smarmy parody of 1960s hippie feel-good music; Ivy joins Interior on vocals here. Intonation is off in a few numbers (notably on &quot;Kizmiaz,&quot; &quot;The Hot Pearl Snatch,&quot; and &quot;Can Your Pussy Do the Dog?&quot;), but this is not enough to detract from the overall excellence. This rollicking and energetic platter in particular is the equal of any in their canon, and an essential listen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05f0d6e705d0c55a70f887a4438a5c87249b9c42","amp;dn":"The+Cramps+-+A+Date+With+Elvis+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D++320+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05f0d6e705d0c55a70f887a4438a5c87249b9c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,240,214,231,5,208,197,90,112,248,135,164,67,138,92,135,36,155,156,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
