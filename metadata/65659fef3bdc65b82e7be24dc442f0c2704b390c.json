The chapters are extensively illustrated and deal with such topics as symmetry elements, operations and descriptors, symmetry guidelines, high-fidelity pseudosymmetry, crystallographic symmetry, molecular gears, and experimental techniques, including X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. As an additional feature, 3D animations of most of the structures and molecules covered are available online at wiley.com. As a result, chemists learn how to understand and predict molecular structures and reactivity. Authored by a renowned expert with numerous publications and an excellent track record in research and teaching, this is a useful source for graduate students and researchers working in the field of organic synthesis, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and crystallography, while equally serving as supplementary reading for courses on stereochemistry, organic synthesis, or crystallography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65659fef3bdc65b82e7be24dc442f0c2704b390c","amp;dn":"Symmetry%2C+Spectroscopy%2C+and+Crystallography+-+Robert+Glaser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65659fef3bdc65b82e7be24dc442f0c2704b390c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,101,159,239,59,220,101,184,46,123,226,77,196,66,240,194,112,75,57,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
