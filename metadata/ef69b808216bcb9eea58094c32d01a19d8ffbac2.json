Their antiquity is stupendous, dating back some 36,000 years B.C. The writer is Thoth, an Atlantean Priest-King, who founded a colony in ancient Egypt after the sinking of the mother country. He was the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, erroneously attributed to Cheops. In it he incorporated his knowledge of the ancient wisdom and also securely secreted records and instruments of ancient Atlantis.\n\nFor some 16,000 years, he ruled the ancient race of Egypt, from approximately 52,000 B.C. to 36,000 B.C. At that time, the ancient barbarous race among which he and his followers had settled had been raised to a high degree of civilization.\n\nThis is in .pdf format with navigation link to each table number.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef69b808216bcb9eea58094c32d01a19d8ffbac2","amp;dn":"Emerald+Tablets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef69b808216bcb9eea58094c32d01a19d8ffbac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,105,184,8,33,107,203,158,234,88,9,76,50,208,26,25,216,255,186,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
