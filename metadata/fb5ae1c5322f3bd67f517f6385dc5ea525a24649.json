The soundtrack still features snippets of dialogue, which simply aren't as effective separated from the film as those from Pulp Fiction, but the unified collection of '70s soul and funk is refreshing. \r\nHe has wisely selected a batch of songs that haven't been worn out by oldies radio, building the bulk of the album with cult favorites like Bobby Womack's &quot;Across 110th Street,&quot; Bill Withers' &quot;Who Is He (And What Is He to You?),&quot; Randy Crawford's &quot;Street Life,&quot; Minnie Riperton's &quot;Inside My Love,&quot; the Vampire Sound Inc.'s &quot;The Lions and the Cucumber&quot; and Pam Grier's &quot;Long Time Woman.&quot; Only &quot;Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot; and &quot;Natural High,&quot; as well as the Grass Roots' &quot;Midnight Confessions,&quot; are familiar oldies items, but they play an integral part in the film itself and help make the soundtrack a thoroughly enjoyable, compulsively listenable experience.
