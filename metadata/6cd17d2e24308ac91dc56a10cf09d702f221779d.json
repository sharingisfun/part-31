Many of the 1940's cartoons remain very funny. Bugs Bunny dresses up as Brunnhilda and rides in to the strains of &quot;Tannhauser&quot; in &quot;Herr Meets Hare&quot; (1945), a gag Chuck Jones re-used to greater effect in &quot;What's Opera, Doc&quot; a dozen years later. In &quot;Russian Rhapsody&quot; (1940) some of the gremlins who sabotage Hitler's bomber are caricatures of the Warner Bros. artists. Chuck Jones appears as a chunky, pinkish-tan homunculus swinging a mallet; Friz Freleng is a little green man with a saw-like nose. Younger viewers may find the references to wartime shortages puzzling--or fail to recognize the caricatures of Hermann Goering, Hideki Tojo and Joseph Stalin. Some of the other cartoons can still bring down the house, including &quot;Satan's Waitin'&quot; (1954), in which Sylvester manages to lose all nine of his lives in pursuit of Tweety, and &quot;Bear Feat&quot; (1949), another exercise in futility for Jones' Three Bears. The early musicals featuring Bosko, Foxy (or Freddy Fox) and Buddy have not aged well. Created by Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, these characters were modeled on Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, but lack charm and personality. Some more recent films reveal how social attitudes have changed. &quot;Wild Wife,&quot; a spoof of a suburban housewife's tribulations, may have seemed hilarious in 1954; today, it's just a laundry list of sexist gags. Like the previous installments, Volume 6 comes loaded with extras. The rarest are five shorts Friz Freleng directed at MGM in 1938. Producer Fred Quimby lured Freleng away from Warner Bros.--only to insist he adapt the comic strip &quot;The Captain and the Kids,&quot; Rudolph Dirks' version of &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids.&quot; Freleng correctly predicted the films would flop as the characters were &quot;the meanest little bastards in the world,&quot; and soon returned to Warners.[/QUOTE]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard01-9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard01-9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard02-10.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard02-10.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard03-12.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard03-12.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard04-11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard04-11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard05-11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard05-11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard06-7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard06-7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------my rips----------\n\nUnlike the other volumes, these are all the correct frame rate.\n\nI ripped everything except the music only tracks.
