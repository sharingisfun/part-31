Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuests: Joe List, Aaron Berg\n\nEpisode 226 A scratchy voiced Anthony begins todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TACS talking about the changes in doing a show at his house versus the NY studio, the lame motto of the New York State Department of Corrections, ColbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new show, and the creepiness of the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Walk.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ant then gets into Freddie GrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s settlement, Kansas StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marching band sucking a dick, South DakotaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Jerk and DriveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ campaign, the burning of SturgisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Full Throttle Saloon, and we learn about Jewish lightning. Aaron Burg and Joe List join the show to talk about the pros and cons of living in another country, gun laws, weeding out gun nuts, and places to jerk off. The guys chat about Last Comic Standing, not killing people, shaming, invasion of privacy, getting in trouble for being Ã¢â‚¬Å“non-PC,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we hear about Aaron's book Ã¢â‚¬Å“American Etiquette,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they discuss Trump as president, Hillary Clinton on ABC News, Fox News correspondents, and the Kim Davis with her hillbilly husband pics. They then talk about campaign songs, honing in on your gaydar, play a little game of Ã¢â‚¬Å“would youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Buck Angel and Bailey Jay, and end the show watching a Caitlyn Jenner interview with Matt Lauer.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb0aa3a0c5cfb98ac2c8cbc051a4bbbd0fc5353","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-09-09+Joe+List+Aaron+Berg+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb0aa3a0c5cfb98ac2c8cbc051a4bbbd0fc5353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,176,170,58,12,92,251,152,172,44,140,188,5,26,75,187,208,252,83,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
