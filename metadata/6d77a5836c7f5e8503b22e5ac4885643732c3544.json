Shortly after, they recruited their friend and photographer Glenn\nGregory on vocals to complete their lineup for Heaven 17. Like The Human League, Heaven\n17 heavily used synthesizers and drum machines, the Linn LM-1 programmed by Ware\nparticularly contributing to their signature sound. Session musicians were used for Bass and\nGuitar (John Wilson) and Grand Piano (Nick Plytas). They had some minor hits including the\nearly &quot;Play To Win&quot;, featured on the album Penthouse and Pavement. Their debut single\n&quot;(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang&quot; from the same album had attracted some\nattention, becoming a left-wing anthem for a while, and was banned by Mike Read, a Radio 1\nDJ for the BBC, because of its overtly political lyrics, though it still reached #45 in the UK\nsingles chart.\n\nIn the interim the band produced two further LPs as BEF. The first being Music of Quality &amp;\nDistinction featuring Glenn Gregory, Paula Yates, Billy Mackenzie, Paul Jones, Bernadette\nNolan and Gary Glitter. The tracks were cover versions of songs that Ware, Marsh &amp; Gregory\nhad grown up listening to. A second volume was issued in the early 1990s (simply titled\nMusic of Quality &amp; Distinction 2), this time featuring artists such as Scritti Politti's Green\nGartside, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Lalah Hathaway.\n\n\n\n\n1.
