Apaches is unique among gore films in that it was designed to be shown to young children in primary schools to teach them safety. A bunch of children play cowboys-and-Indians on a farm, and die horrible deaths. I figure this thing was successful in keeping the kiddies out of emergency rooms... and putting them in mental hospitals instead.\n\nAlso included are some shorts from the same folks:\n\nJimmyyyyyy (Electical substations)\nThe Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water (water safety, featuring Donald Pleasance)\nOne More Dave (Drunk Driving)\nSearching (Fire safety)\nThat's the last time I go to Willard's Chemists (Cheap medications)\nThe Finishing Line (Railway safety; very famous).\n\nAlso a Spanish anti-drinking thing.\n\nReseeded from youtube, there seems to be a demand for this sort of thing. In flv format (mostly).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9641b233fdce7ededf6cbbfc4bc67fd27ecfb885","amp;dn":"Apaches+%281977%29+Unique+Horror+Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9641b233fdce7ededf6cbbfc4bc67fd27ecfb885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,65,178,51,253,206,126,222,223,108,187,252,75,198,127,210,126,207,184,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
