So, if someone on the PC experiences a crash, so will you on a mac! This is the SAME GAME, just for mac! With that said:\nThe game will crash every 5 minutes.\nIn order to prevent crashes, set skip frame rate to OFF in OPTIONS under the MAIN MENU.\n\nHaven't tested multiplayer yet, but single player is awesome!\nBe sure to save every 10 minutes or so!\n\n====SEED IT OR LOSE IT====\n\nThanks!\nAypolo\n\nPS: I'll try to update the torrent when the next big update comes out. It will be in a separate torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4936f43db5e990583f655ae8983e7160d3f8fa2","amp;dn":"Terraria+-+Mac+v1.03+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4936f43db5e990583f655ae8983e7160d3f8fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,147,111,67,219,94,153,5,131,246,85,174,137,131,231,22,13,63,143,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
