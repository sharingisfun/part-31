I never really saw an update since then, but I did find a few more floating around the net.\n\nWell, I decided to update the file of icons for everyone!  The originals (included herein) were 512x512 to keep Mac users happy, but as a PC guy myself, I only created files in the updates that are 256x256.  Sorry, Mac guys!\n\nAnyway, I've included all the original files and what updates I found and added icons from Waves 2 and 3, the miniseries since the launch of the New 52, the Digital First titles, new DC logos, and even a couple of the DC Nation titles.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58d05f93afaa690f5eb9a8b90d007b8394329a0","amp;dn":"DC+Comics+Computer+Icons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58d05f93afaa690f5eb9a8b90d007b8394329a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,141,5,249,58,250,166,144,245,235,154,139,144,208,7,184,57,67,41,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
