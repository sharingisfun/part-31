T-helper cells\nmediates immune response by providing help to Blymphocytes\nin antibody production as well as these cells on\nactivation produces soluble factors that amplifies immune\nresponse of the host. On the other hand T- suppressor/\ncytotoxic cells are capable of killing tumor and infected cells.\nNK cells are surveillance cells of the immune system that can\ndirectly destroy tumor cells and infected cells very efficiently\nwithout any prior sensitization. Considering their importance\nin immune response, present study was done to enumerate\nthese cells in peripheral blood of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Art of Living (AOL)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ teachers,\nnormal controls and cancer patients by flowcytometry in order\nto find out if there is any change in these groups.\nIn the present study total T-cells and its T-helper subset were\nsignificantly higher in AOL teachers and normal controls as\ncompared to cancer patients. However, no significant\ndifference occurs in these cells between AOL teachers and\nnormal subjects. A significant difference was found in NK\ncells that was significantly higher (p&lt;.0001) in AOL teachers\nas compared to normal and cancer patients. No significant\ndifference was seen in NK cell population between normal\nsubjects and cancer patients. Since other factors are same in\nnormal subjects and AOL teachers the higher NK cells in AOL\nteachers could be attributed to the practice of AOL (Sudarshan\nKriya).\nIntroduction\nThe deciphering of a common language for brain and immune\nsystem seems to herald a dramatically new view of this tworecognition\nnetwork and the way they interact. Physical and\npsychological stimuli may set a pattern of neurotransmitter,\nhormones and cytokines which may act on receptors of\nimmune cells causing alteration of its effector population and\nfunction through induction of chemical mediators like\ncytokines (Blalock 1994). In turn cytokines can act on the brain\ncells and endocrine cells through their receptor to modulate\ntheir functions.\nIt has been shown beyond doubt that stress is associated with\na distinct set of physiological changes, most notably on the\nimmune-neuro-endocrine axis (Brines,1994). These are non\nnonadaptive\nand potentially can lead to disease. Certainly,\nrelaxation techniques like Sudarshan Kriya and Pranayam\nmay have profound effect on the reversal of the stress thereby\nit may potentiate the immune functions of the host. Despite\ntherapeutic adaptation of the relaxation response for a variety\nof somatic disorders, its impact on the immune system remains\nunknown.\nIt has been well documented that cancer in most cases, is\nassociated with immuno-suppression and a better immune\nresponse is associated with better prognosis Most of the cancer\npatients have shown to have more stress and anxiety not only\nbecause of its diagnosis but due to treatment as well. Most of\nthe anti cancer drugs are antiproliferative and lead to\nimmunosuppression that may persist during the period of\nremission. Such down regulation of immune response could\nbe related to higher degree of recurrence in such cases.\nTherefore, present study has been planned to observe immune\nstatus of AOL teachers, cancer patients and normal subjects\nby quantitative estimation of major lymhocyte subsets in the\nperipheral blood using two colour flowcytometry technique.\n\n\n\nKriya,Sudarshan,Sri,Ravi,Shankar,Ravishankar,Jai,Gurudev,knowledge,higher,wisdom,love,peace,joy,smile,Rishi,\n\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar 's Sudarshan Kriya Does the Magic!\n\nI mean... every one loves Guruji and His amazing knowledge !\n\n\nJai Gurudev!\n:)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artofliving.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artofliving.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iahv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iahv.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.yesplus.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.yesplus.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artoflivingpune.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artoflivingpune.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.artoflivingprojects.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.artoflivingprojects.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe hope you enjoy being \nTotally Taken Care Of \nBy our beloved Master:\nSri Sri Ravishankar ji!\n\nENJOY!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71c30643e4350447b1f17d7a3124c7e83b9e7c3a","amp;dn":"Kriya%5C%27s+Flowcytometric+Study+of+T-cell+Subset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71c30643e4350447b1f17d7a3124c7e83b9e7c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,195,6,67,228,53,4,71,177,241,125,122,49,36,199,232,59,158,124,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
