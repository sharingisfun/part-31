Date: 2010-11-15\nGenre: Hard Rock\nLabel: Rock Candy Records\nSource: CD\nType: Remastered\nQuality: VBR, 44.1kHz, Joint Stereo\n\nFormed in Columbus, Ohio this uncompromising four\nman hard rock band rapidly established a\nreputation as one of the most fearless,\nuncompromising acts on the scene. Moving quickly,\nCasablanca offshoot Millenium Records were quick\nto spot their potential, snapping them up as a\nsort of biker rock antidote to the flamboyant\nstadium cavorting of label mates Kiss and Angel.\nProduced by Grand Funk Railroad drummer Don\nBrewer, the GODZ debut album is an explosive\nstatement laced with thick, bottom heavy riffs and\nsimplistic, almost primal, guitar solos, whilst\nthe lyrical content makes Kiss seem positively\nintellectual by comparison. Best of all, however,\nis the pure unrelenting power of the rhythm\nsection; band leader and bassist Eric Moore\noutgonzoing Ted Nugent by a country mile. Make no\nmistake, this is a musical Mad Max soundtrack\nwritten and performed with motorcycles, whiskey\nand women in mind. Tracks such as Gotta Keep A\nRunnin, Under The Table and a choice\ninterpretation of Golden Earrings Candys Going\nBad make for some of the best hard rock music to\nhave emerged from the mid seventies.\n\n24-bit remastering from original source tapes,\n4,000 word essay about the making of the album,\nadditional previously unseen photos spread out\nover a 16 page full colour booklet.\n\n1.
