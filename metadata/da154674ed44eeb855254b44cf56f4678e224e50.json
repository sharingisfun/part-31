He was born in Berlin, but felt in love with Paris. In 1927, Walter Ruttmann directed the fantastic &quot;Berlin: Die Sinfonie der GroÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸stadt&quot;.\n\nSurprisingly, Brazil was tuned with Europe and was the unique country in Latin America that produced modern movies about and influenced by the metropolis. In 1926, it was released a documentary about Recife. In 1928, Humberto Mauro directed his &quot;Sinfonia de Cataguases&quot;, (&quot;Symphony of Cataguases&quot;) a short inspired in &quot;Berlin: Die Sinfonie der GroÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸stadt&quot;. In Porto Alegre, it was produced &quot;A Princesinha do Sul&quot;.\n\n&quot;SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, Sinfonia da MetrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pole&quot;, directed by the Hungarian Adalberto Kemeny and Rudolf Rex Lustig, is the most famous and important Brazilian documentary totally inspired in the German classic. The film begins with the dawn, with the city &quot;waking-up&quot;, ending in the sunset, showing the dynamics of a big city and its dwellers. My vote is eight.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:                                      Sao.Paulo_a.Metropolitan.Symphony_1929_VHSRip.XviD.SILENT.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           864,520,192                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                                       \nPreload (in ms):                                       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):             \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                               \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:02:08                \nFrame Count:                                    111698             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  608 x 464 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.310                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.310                     \nFrames Per Second:                              29.970          \nPics Per Second:                                29.970            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1849                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.219&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da154674ed44eeb855254b44cf56f4678e224e50","amp;dn":"Sao.Paulo_a.Metropolitan.Symphony_1929_VHSRip.XviD.SILENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da154674ed44eeb855254b44cf56f4678e224e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,21,70,116,237,68,238,184,85,37,75,68,207,86,244,103,142,34,78,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
