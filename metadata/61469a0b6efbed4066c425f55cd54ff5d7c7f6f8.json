Lindsay becomes possessed and then kills Charlie.\n\nCharlie's three kids are reported missing and a reward is announced for their safe return. Several months later, Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller are in the Humboldt County woods in search of illegally-grown cannabis plants to steal. After stealing one and fleeing, they take shelter in a cabin in the woods.\n\nUpon entering they see three strange creatures, later confirmed to be Charlie's kids, and turn them in for the reward. The feral children are placed in isolation at a child development research center for a few months until they are deemed well enough to be returned to familial custody. When Charlie's brother, Dan Sanders and his wife Jody come to collect them, they are told they can have them if they agree to stay in a large suburban middle-class home fitted with security cameras. Jody is reluctant to take the kids at first but soon adjusts to having them. In an attempt to bond with their new children, Jody auditions for a ballet performance, Swan Lake, and is cast in the lead role as the Swan Queen.\n\nMeanwhile, a continuing pattern of bizarre paranormal activity in their new home makes them investigate further. They eventually learn from the children that the attacks on their home are by &quot;Mama&quot;, the mother of the children, who is under a curse and is trying to get them back so she can sacrifice both herself and the children. Maria, the couple's Hispanic live-in maid, is frightened and keeps experimenting with various rituals, Catholic and otherwise, to ward off the evil spirits in the house. During the day, Dan is frustrated with the modest progress of his test subjects at a primate intelligence research facility; ironically, Dan is not bright enough to realize that one of the chimpanzees, Caesar, is now actually much smarter than him.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61469a0b6efbed4066c425f55cd54ff5d7c7f6f8","amp;dn":"Scary+Movie+5.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61469a0b6efbed4066c425f55cd54ff5d7c7f6f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,70,154,11,110,251,237,64,102,196,37,245,92,213,79,245,215,199,246,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
