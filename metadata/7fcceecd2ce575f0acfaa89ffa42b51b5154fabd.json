Band sounds somewhat distant from the microphone.\nNevertheless, my favorite Hooker live recording.\n\nSorry for the VQF audio, but this was ripped in an era when VQF was a viable and state-of-the-art codec. I've included the Winamp VQF plugin for those without a VQF player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fcceecd2ce575f0acfaa89ffa42b51b5154fabd","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+Live+at+the+Rising+Sun+%5B1977%5D+VQF+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fcceecd2ce575f0acfaa89ffa42b51b5154fabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,204,238,205,44,229,117,240,172,250,168,159,250,66,181,27,81,84,250,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
