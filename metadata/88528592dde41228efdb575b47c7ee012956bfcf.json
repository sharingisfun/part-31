Enjoy a unique and innovative game:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Strategy: survive massive attacks each night by building strong walls and placing turrets wisely.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Physics: build wisely or your structures will collapse! And you will need them to defend your base, or build bridges and high towers to access remote locations\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Water cycle: rain, infiltration, underground rivers and lakes... be careful during the heavy rains, or you could be surprised by a sudden water level rise!\n\nYou are a representative of the CRAFT &amp; Co company. You are selling automated fabrication tools across the galaxy when your spacecraft crashes into a hostile planet. Use the tools you sell and the local resources to build up all of what you'll need to survive and eventually be able to escape the planet.\n\nAmong other features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fun from the start: no awfully slow digging, so you can concentrate on the exploration, fight and strategy.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Huge world with global real-time simulation of the environment, physics and water cycle.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Plenty of minerals to dig, plants to harvest, items, weapons and turrets to craft, and monsters to fight!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ No swords or magic here! It's a real science-fiction game, with fast and fun laser guns fights!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intelligent monsters: they will find the best path to attack your defenses. And be careful: even if they can't move through walls, they can still destroy them!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88528592dde41228efdb575b47c7ee012956bfcf","amp;dn":"Dig+or+Die+v0.06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88528592dde41228efdb575b47c7ee012956bfcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,82,133,146,221,228,18,40,239,219,87,91,71,199,238,1,41,86,191,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
