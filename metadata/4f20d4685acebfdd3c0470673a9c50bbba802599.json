Morgan is a historical materialist treatise written by Friedrich Engels and published in 1884. It is partially based on notes by Karl Marx to Lewis H. Morgan's book Ancient Society.\n\n\nThe book begins with an extensive discussion of Ancient Society, which divide between various stages in human development, as commonly understood in Engels' time. In contrast to other contemporary essays on the subject, Engels emphasizes the importance not of primitive psychological development but rather of social relations of power and control over material resources, sometimes related to the development of new technologies. Morgan, whose account of prehistory Engels largely accepts as given, focuses primarily on the first two stages of Savagery and Barbarism but only ventures as far as the transition into Civilization. The terms Savagery and Barbarism as used by Morgan were meant to be objectively descriptive and not to imply the negative connotations they often carry today. Engels summarizes these stages as follows:\nSavagery - the period in which man's appropriation of products in their natural state predominates; the products of human art are chiefly instruments which assist this appropriation.\nBarbarism - the period during which man learns to breed domestic animals and to practice agriculture, and acquires methods of increasing the supply of natural products by human activity.\nCivilization - the period in which man learns a more advanced application of work to the products of nature, the period of industry proper and of art.\nIn the following chapter on family, Engels tries to connect the transition into these stages with a change in the way that family is defined and the rules by which it is governed. Much of this is still taken from Morgan, although Engels begins to intersperse his own ideas on the role of family into the text. Morgan acknowledges four stages in the family.\n\n\nFor more info about us or this book please vist us on &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25585203372&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25585203372&lt;/a&gt;\nFor a secular IRAQ We believe that the separation of religion and state is the solution. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f20d4685acebfdd3c0470673a9c50bbba802599","amp;dn":"%C3%98%C2%A3%C3%98%C2%B5%C3%99%E2%80%9E+%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%B9%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%A6%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%A9+%C3%99%CB%86%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%99%E2%80%A6%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%99%C6%92%C3%99%C5%A0%C3%98%C2%A9+%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%AE%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%B5%C3%98%C2%A9+%C3%99%CB%86%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%E2%80%9E%C3%98%C2%AF%C3%99%CB%86%C3%99%E2%80%9E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f20d4685acebfdd3c0470673a9c50bbba802599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,32,212,104,90,206,191,221,60,4,112,103,58,156,80,187,186,128,37,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
