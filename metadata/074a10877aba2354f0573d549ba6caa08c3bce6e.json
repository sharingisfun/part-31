It's actually cheaper to buy the game with the soundtrack included than the soundtrack by itself so I recommend just doing that (I don't completely control iTunes prices and whatnot).\n\n\nSome Relevant Data:\n\nMP3 V0\nSourced Directly from Masters\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n\n1. Sigh (Intro)\n2. Wasted Effort\n3. Barely Music\n4. F-\n5. No Idea What I'm Doing\n6. Self Doubt\n7. Boring\n8. Why Try?\n9. Failure\n10. Missed Milestone 1\n11.
