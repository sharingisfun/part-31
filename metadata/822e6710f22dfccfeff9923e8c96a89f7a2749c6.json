An environmental activist, he used to have it all: a home and organic farm outside Sandstone, Minnesota; a wife, his high school sweetheart, Connie; and an infant son, Kaidin. Then, on 23 February 2002, Kaidin fell asleep to the somber strains of Mozart\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Requiem\\&quot; and, for reasons that remain unexplained medically, never awoke. Connie discovered the lifeless body the next morning. The couple\\&amp;#039;s shared pain would become too much for their marriage to withstand, and they eventually divorced.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1 Breakfast with My Shadow\n2 Alone At A Party In A Ghost Town\n3 Pricess Bride\n4 As Long As Your Happy\n5 Chandeliers\n6 Buried Poetry (recorded live)\n7 All Together Alone\n8 My Fictitious Life With Amily\n9 Grappling Hook/Northern Lights\n10 Lights Inside My Head\n11 The Sparks and Spaces Between Your Cells\n12 Beautiful Boy\n13 I Guess This Dream Is For Me\n14 State Of The Union\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822e6710f22dfccfeff9923e8c96a89f7a2749c6","amp;dn":"Cloud+Cult+-+Aurora+Borealis+2004+VBR+320+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822e6710f22dfccfeff9923e8c96a89f7a2749c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,46,103,16,242,45,252,207,239,249,146,62,140,150,168,159,122,39,73,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
