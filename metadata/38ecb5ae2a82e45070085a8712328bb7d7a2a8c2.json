It also reveals formerly unknown facets of the complex interplay of the two major biological adaptation mechanisms. The results apply to models from computational intelligence and evolutionary biology alike, thus contribute to the transfer of principles of biological adaptation to digital processing system.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38ecb5ae2a82e45070085a8712328bb7d7a2a8c2","amp;dn":"Dynamics+of+evolution+and+learning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38ecb5ae2a82e45070085a8712328bb7d7a2a8c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,236,181,174,42,130,228,80,112,8,90,135,18,50,139,183,215,162,168,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
