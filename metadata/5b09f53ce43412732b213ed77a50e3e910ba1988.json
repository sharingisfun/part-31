December 12, 2008 is a day Mike Sanderson will never forget. Following a tussle with another player, MikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son, 21-year-old hockey player Don Sanderson, fell to the ice, hitting his head. After three weeks in a coma, Don Sanderson died. His death re-ignited a simmering debate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ never far from the surface in this country ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ about fighting in hockey. \nFor those who know hockey best ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the players and the coaches ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the game, and the fighting, are governed by an unwritten law some insist makes the sport safer. They call it The Code and claim it's about pride, solidarity, even sportsmanship. The Code is often upheld by a player who is the biggest and the toughest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the enforcer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whose talent on the ice lies not in scoring goals, but in protecting his teammates and exacting revenge on an opponent who dares to take a shot at his teamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s star player.\n\nIn this fifth estate investigation, you will meet some of the men who, for better or worse, have lived by The Code. Reporter Bob McKeown interviews players, hockey officials and sports commentators, including Don Cherry and Bob McCown, in this in-depth look at both sides of the debate. \n\nFormer NHLers Nick Kypreos and Marty McSorley re-live their experience of The Code and how it ended their hockey careers, but for very different reasons. Viewers will hear from the NHLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s current ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œheavyweight champion,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Montreal CanadiensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Georges Laraque as well as Brian Burke, President and General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nAnd Bob McKeown interviews Don SandersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father, Mike, for whom fighting in hockey is not a debate, but a tragedy.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 44mn 14s 760ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 977 Kbps\nAspect            : 560 x 336 (1.667) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 113 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b09f53ce43412732b213ed77a50e3e910ba1988","amp;dn":"The+Code_CBC+the+fifth+estate_02-27-09_PDTV_XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b09f53ce43412732b213ed77a50e3e910ba1988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,9,245,60,228,52,18,115,43,33,62,215,122,80,227,233,16,186,25,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
