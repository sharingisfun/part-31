He was a journalist, a poet and a novelist. He wrote 80 books and 200 short stories in addition to his other work. He is perhaps best remembered for his Ã¢â‚¬ËœFather BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stories.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe Man Who Knew Too MuchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has some similarities to the Father Brown stories: Horne Fisher the eponymous hero is connected and indeed related to many of the high-ranking politicians of his age and thus Ã¢â‚¬Ëœknows too muchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ about the background of the mysteries in which he becomes embroiled and which he unravels.
