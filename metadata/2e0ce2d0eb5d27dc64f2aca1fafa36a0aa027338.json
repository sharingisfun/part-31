This is the first complete John Kay and Steppenwolf performance video. While pyrotechnics light up the night, the legendary group creates fireworks of its own with a trademark sound that resonates through a crowd of loyal stalwarts and new young faces. They play all of their hits, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride,&quot; &quot;Sookie Sookie,&quot; &quot;Born To Be Wild,&quot; &quot;The Pusher,&quot; &quot;Monster,&quot; etc. and cross all demographic barriers delivering a phenomenal performance. This particular project is a Steppenwolf milestone because it features the band members with the longest tenure in the band's 35-year history, always led by the incomparable John Kay. &quot;Live In Louisville&quot; shows a revolutionary band that originated in the 60's, that continues to earn new fans in the new millenium.\n\nTrack List:\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\t1.
