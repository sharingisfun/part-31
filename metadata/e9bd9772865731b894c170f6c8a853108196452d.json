The former leader of the British alt-country band the Good Sons, he is now joined by his partner Lou Dalgleish for an album of country duets that sound as if they were written in the 60s or 70s. It's a finely crafted tribute to the classic country duos such as Johnny Cash and June Carter or George Jones and Tammy Wynette, with all the songs written by King and Dalgleish and several sounding like lost classics. They are almost all weepies, with slow or more upbeat stories of pained love affairs, parting and regret, and are thoughtfully sung, with Dalgleish often playing the partner who has angrily pushed off, answering back like Carter singing Jackson. The musicianship is equally impressive, with a classy band that includes Martin Belmont playing a 1963 Fender Stratocaster and Geraint Watkins on piano and 1966 Hammond organ.
