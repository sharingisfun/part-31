DEDICATIONS\n\n  This torrent is dedicated to the life and work of MICHEL THOMAS (1914-2005),\n   a man who invented an ingenious and original method for teaching languages.\n\n Thomas might easily have shared his work with the world. Instead, he chose to \nkeep it to himself for fifty years, revealing the &quot;secret&quot; to just a handful of\n  wealthy celebrities prepared to pay his extortionate fees. Thanks, Michel!\n\n  The torrent is also dedicated to the team at Hodder Arnold, publishers of\n courses in eight new languages (most of which are pretty good). They are also\n compulsive liars, I'm afraid to say. This little exchange on the official MT    \n    Facebook page is typical of the misleading advertising the company has\n                           been using since the 1990s:\n\n    Abhishek: I have completed [the] introductory spanish course but when \n    [will] I be able to understand spanish movies...is it be possible after \n    [the advanced course]??\n\n    Hodder Education: The Advanced courses will take you to the standard of\n    an English A-Level, so you should be able to follow and understand films\n    after completing this level...\n\n  Finally, this torrent is dedicated to the original Joe Kane, compiler of the \n earlier versions of the torrent. Joe passed away a few months ago and, believe \n it or not, one of his deathbed requests was that his torrents should continue  \n   to be seeded. Version 3 of this torrent has been produced to honour this\n                              request. Thanks, Joe!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. INTRODUCTION\n\nThank you for downloading this torrent. It contains:\n\n - All the Michel Thomas Method recordings now available for native English \n   speakers - 196 CDs of material covering 12 languages\n - Copies of the booklets which accompany these courses\n - Transcripts of all the courses published before 2007\n - Two new courses, in French and Spanish, from Paul Noble (who uses a method \n   similar to the one used by Michel Thomas), and copies of the booklets which\n   accompany them\n\nThe courses for native French speakers have been moved to a separate torrent.\n\nThis torrent does not yet contain:\n\n - Any of the courses produced for native Spanish speakers\n - Any of the courses produced for schools\n - Transcripts for most courses published after 2007\n - Scans of the two books about Michel Thomas ('The Test Of Courage', a \n   biography by Christopher Robbins, and 'The Learning Revolution', by \n   Jonathon Solity)\n\nIf you have any of these, please upload them.\n\nTechnical information:\n\n - For Version 3 of the torrent, all the sound files have been re-ripped from\n   original CDs\n - New, consistent metadata format which ought to make the sound files easier \n   to use in portable music players (64Kbps bitrate)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. HOW TO USE MICHEL THOMAS\n\nNot used Michel Thomas before? \n\nIt's better to do one language at a time (not all twelve simultaneously). One \nCD a day would be realistic, but you can stop studying at any point during a\nrecording and pick it up where you left it the next day.\n\nStudy Foundation first, then Advanced, then Vocabulary (if it's available for\nthe language you're learning), then Builder (if it's available).\n\nIf you're learning French, German, Spanish or Italian, there are Review courses\navailable which summarise material from the Foundation and Advanced courses.\n\nThe Foundation courses used to be called &quot;Basic&quot; courses. You can also find \n&quot;Introductory&quot; courses, which are identical to the first 2 CDs of the \n&quot;Foundation&quot; courses.\n\nFor full instructions, read one of the course guides in the &quot;Booklets&quot; folder. \n(The instructions are more or less the same for all courses.)\n\nHappy learning!\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.
