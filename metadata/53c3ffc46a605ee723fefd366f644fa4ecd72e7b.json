The song is also included on the Speed motion picture soundtrack. \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n\r\n    Everywhere at Once (1983 Geffen Records) U.S. No. 186\r\n\r\n    &quot;Shaky City&quot; (2:27)\r\n    &quot;Magic Touch&quot; (3:19)\r\n    &quot;Oldest Story in the World&quot; (3:19)\r\n    &quot;Lie, Beg, Borrow, and Steal&quot; (2:45)\r\n    &quot;Play the Breaks&quot; (4:17)\r\n    &quot;How Long Will it Take?&quot; (2:30)\r\n    &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; (3:34)\r\n    &quot;My Life Ain't Easy&quot; (2:37)\r\n    &quot;Inch By Inch&quot; (2:35)\r\n    &quot;I'll Get Lucky&quot; (2:42)\r\n    &quot;Everywhere at Once&quot; (3:19)\r\n\r\n\r\nUploader speaks: \r\n\r\nIt was good back then and still sounds real good\r\nIt did get enough airplay to make famous but not so much that it \r\nburned you out.
