Coverage of Newcastle United's performance in the 2011/2012 season, including match analysis and interviews.\n\nNewcastle United fans have seen their team come a long way since earning promotion back to the Premier League in 2010 and nobody could have predicted the exciting season that lay ahead at the start of the 2011/12 campaign. This was a season of rejuvenation as changes were made both on and off the pitch with fresh talent drafted in, in the form of CissÃƒÂ©, Cabaye, Ba and Obertan to name a few, and manager Alan Pardew delivering a brand of attacking football that earned him both the Barclays and LMA Manager of the Season awards. With the new signings settling in well, and with a good core of players already at the club, Newcastle United undertook an incredible journey that saw them return to the upper echelons of the Premier League and secure a place in Europe the following season, only narrowly missing out on a Champions League place. There was plenty to cheer this season as stalwarts of the team Fabricio Coloccini, Cheick Tiote and Jonas Gutierrez all solidified their reputations at the heart of the club and Tim Krul and Hatem Ben Arfa both delivered impressive displays. Relive this exhilarating season in full with highlights of every game and every goal from the campaign including victories over Sunderland, Liverpool, Chelsea and a dominating win over 2010/11 champions Manchester United.\n\nLanguage: English Quality : DVDRip Format : AVI \nVideo  : H.264, 720x406, 25 fps, 1097 kbps \nAudio : 48 kHz, AC3 Dolby Digital, 2 ch, 192 kbps\nDuration: 1 Hour 50 min\ncredit: SuperSewelly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74011055e2ff5e2fe48b6af5d7e5a55e1adcc71","amp;dn":"Newcastle+United+Season+Review+2011%2F12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74011055e2ff5e2fe48b6af5d7e5a55e1adcc71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,64,17,5,94,47,245,226,254,72,182,175,93,126,90,85,225,173,204,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
