Both were dramatically upstaged when BC hired a secretary, Bonnie Bunny, a rather dimwitted, blond, braless bunnygirl. The strip was written and illustrated by Chuck Fiala, and originally serialized in The Comic Reader fanzine between 1979 and 1984. In 1987, Eclipse collected the strips and published them in B&amp;W over two issues.\n\nBunches of thanks to Mr. Fiala and the scanners!
