Her name is Linnzi Zaorski, and in the broad field of New Orleans Jazz artists she is an extreme breath of fresh air. Her voice maybe somewhat high pitched and she might be playing it all up as camp, but Linnzi Zaorski is a unique musical commodity and her CD, Hotsy-TotsyÃ‚ï¿½ is a sheer delight to listen to.\n\nMs. Zaorski is the kind of artist that you find standing in front of a 1940s style microphone, in a long flowing black gown, gardenia in her hair, and lighted so gently as to only see two pair of fire red lips belt out the tunes of Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, and Johnny Mercer to a smoke filled cabaret. She and her Hotsy-TotsyÃ‚ï¿½ CD are a throwback to an era that many might have forgot. But in recording these classics, Ms. Zaorski compels us to discover such gems as Hernando's Hideaway; I Can't Give You Anything But Love; Caravan; and All Of Me,Ã‚ï¿½ as well as nine other exquisitely delivered tunes. Backed up by a capable group of musicians including Seva Venet (guitar), Charlie Fardella (trumpet), Robert Snow (bass), Matt Rhody (violin), and Chaz Leary (washboard), Ms. Zaorski and Delta Royale transport you to another place and time when Technicolor wasn't the norm and times were simple, and people still dressed up to go out on a Saturday night.
