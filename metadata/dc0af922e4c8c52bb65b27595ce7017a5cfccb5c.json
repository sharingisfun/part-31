Contains naughty language and Christopher Walken impressions!\n \n\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get this out of the way: Yes, this movie is called McBain. No, it has nothing to do with what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re thinking: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a biopic of Diane McBain, star of the 1960 TV series Surfside 6. Oh, or that Simpsons character either.\n\nNo, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no Mendoza for McBain to take out in this one. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just in the silly movie series The Simpsons came up with. Probably only took them a couple minutes too. Mendoza...Ha! This McBain is much more legitimate and creative. Its drug dealer is named Escobar.\n\nChristopher Walken (Mousehunt, Joe Dirt, The Country Bears, Gigli, Kangaroo Jack) stars as the titular McBain. When the man who rescued him from a POW camp is executed by a Colombian dictator, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for McBain to put together a ragtag group to avenge their friend. He rounds up a smooth talking technology expert, a black guy who is afraid of flying, and a guy who repeatedly asks him if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really a good idea to rip off The A-Team so blatantly.\n\nFinally, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to take out the dictator and what follows is possibly the most incoherent mess of an action film there ever was. The body count soars, plot threads are introduced and discarded at a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice and a WrestleMania hat is given prominent screentime. Evidently, nobody ever told the producers of McBain that 80s action flicks were out of style, or that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not very badass to make your supposed action hero a welder (McBain is a professional welder, we forgot to mention that until now. Also, his first name is Bobby. Both of these things are true.)\n\nMcBain is the movie that will have you saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seriously? Christopher Walken did this only three years before Pulp Fiction?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Join Mike, Kevin, Bill and Rainier Wolfcastle for McBain: LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Get Silly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0af922e4c8c52bb65b27595ce7017a5cfccb5c","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+McBain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0af922e4c8c52bb65b27595ce7017a5cfccb5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,10,249,34,228,200,197,43,182,91,39,89,92,231,1,122,92,252,203,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
