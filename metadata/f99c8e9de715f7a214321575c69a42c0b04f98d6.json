Finding himself attracted to her, he pretends to be a student in her class, not revealing he's Gannon, whom she despises. As they bob and weave around their mutual growing attraction, they both begin to gain respect for each other's approaches to reporting news, but how will Erica react when she finds out who he really is?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99c8e9de715f7a214321575c69a42c0b04f98d6","amp;dn":"Teacher%27s+Pet++%28Comedy+1958%29++Clark+Gable%2C+Doris+Day+%26amp%3B+Gig+Y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99c8e9de715f7a214321575c69a42c0b04f98d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,156,142,157,231,21,247,162,20,50,21,117,198,154,66,192,176,79,152,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
