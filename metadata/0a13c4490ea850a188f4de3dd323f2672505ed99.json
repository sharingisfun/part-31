His last recording was made soon after in San Francisco,\n\nalso a live recording.\n\n\nThe piano is in need of a tuning but Bill plays with great urgency and energy.\n\n\nAs important a player as Bud Powell IMO.  As with Powell, all jazz pianists\n\nwho came after were strongly influenced by their music.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a13c4490ea850a188f4de3dd323f2672505ed99","amp;dn":"BILL+EVANS+trio+live+at+Ronnie+Scotts+%281980%29+2nd+last+recording","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a13c4490ea850a188f4de3dd323f2672505ed99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,19,196,73,14,168,80,161,136,244,222,61,211,35,242,103,37,5,237,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
