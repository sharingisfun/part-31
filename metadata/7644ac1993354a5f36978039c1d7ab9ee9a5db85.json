Here, Terry is largely playing solo acoustic, with J.C. Burris joining in for harmonica duets every so often; Sticks McGhee and drummer Belton Evans also play on a few cuts. Unlike some solo acoustic blues albums, Sonny's Story is positively infectious. It's hard not to get caught up in Terry's shouts and boogies, and that's one major reason why this is among his best solo recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7644ac1993354a5f36978039c1d7ab9ee9a5db85","amp;dn":"Sonny+Terry+-+Sonny%27s+Story+1960+%281990%29+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7644ac1993354a5f36978039c1d7ab9ee9a5db85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,68,172,25,147,53,74,95,54,151,128,57,193,215,171,158,233,165,219,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
