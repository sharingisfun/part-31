It reached #2 on the Billboard R&amp;B charts and #31 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe Gap Band is an American funk band who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s with their heavily-charged dance anthems and their sentimental and ethereal love songs. Comprising brothers Charlie, Ronnie and Robert Wilson, the band first formed as the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band in 1967 in their hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The group shortened its name to The Gap Band in 1979.\n\nBy 1979, the group had changed its name to The Gap Band, and found success with the groundbreaking single &quot;I Don't Believe You Wanna Get Up and Dance (Oops!)&quot;. But it was in the 1980s that the group found their biggest success, with songs like &quot;Burn Rubber On Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)&quot;, &quot;Humpin' &quot;, &quot;Yearning For Your Love&quot;, &quot;Outstanding&quot;, &quot;You Dropped a Bomb on Me&quot;, &quot;I Found My Baby&quot;, &quot;Early In the Morning&quot;, and &quot;Party Train&quot; further establishing the group as icons. The group found their greatest success in the UK when their 1987 single &quot;Big Fun&quot; reached #4 in the UK chart (&quot;Oops Upside Your Head&quot; had also reached #6 there in 1980).\n\nFour of the band's albums, The Gap Band II, The Gap Band III, Gap Band IV, and Gap Band V - Jammin, achieved platinum selling status, and four of their singles (&quot;All Of My Love&quot;, &quot;Outstanding&quot;, &quot;Burn Rubber On Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)&quot;, and &quot;Early in the Morning&quot;) reached the #1 spot on the Billboard R&amp;B charts. Raymond Calhoun (writer &quot;Outstanding&quot;), Oliver Scott (co-writer &quot;Yearning For Your Love), and arranger/producer Malvin Dino Vice (co-writer &quot;Boys Are Back in Town&quot;), were members of the backing band and major contributors to the Gap Band's successful recordings.\n\nTheir success dwindled at the end of 1984, although they have continued to record albums and are constantly on tour. Brother Charlie ventured into a solo career during a break from the group in the mid-1980s, being featured on the 1985 hit with funk group Zapp titled &quot;Computer Love&quot;. Wilson's powerful vocals would be credited in part for establishing the careers of Guy's Aaron Hall, Keith Sweat, and R. Kelly. The band reunited in 1996, and issued The Gap Band: Live and Well, a live greatest hits album.\n\nEver since the 1990s, the Gap Band's most famous hits have been sampled and covered by the likes of Nas, Snoop Dogg, Warren G., Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat, Notorious B.I.G., II D Extreme, Blackstreet, Shaquille O'Neal, Mia X, and Mary J. Blige. &quot;Outstanding&quot; was even sampled for a famous 1990s commercial for malt liquor.Among the musicians they have inspired are R. Kelly, Keith Sweat, Ruff Endz, Guy, Blackstreet, II D Extreme, Mint Condition, Jagged Edge, D'Extra Wiley, and Aaron Hall. Recently, &quot;You Dropped a Bomb on Me&quot; was featured in the hit videogame Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on funk radio station Bounce FM.\n\nIn mid-2005, Charlie released his third solo album, Charlie, Last Name Wilson, which was produced by R. Kelly.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Hip-O Records released Gold, a 2-CD compilation from the Gap Band.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55ef4dbdda721fa57bd85657f7647a7dd7464c6","amp;dn":"The+Gap+Band+-+You+Dropped+A+Bomb+On+Me+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55ef4dbdda721fa57bd85657f7647a7dd7464c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,94,244,219,221,167,33,250,87,189,133,101,127,118,71,167,221,116,100,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
