Yu. Ishlinsky and Z. K. Sokolovskaya.  \n\n  The sheer personality of Sofya Kovalevskaya, the renowned Russian\n  woman mathematician, was so remarkable, multifaceted, and\n  interesting that the great Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen said to\n  write her biography would need a poem. My aim in writing this book\n  is different and somewhat more modest: it is to present the basic\n  information about her life from the numerous sources available.\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by Michael Burov. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985. \n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFrom the Author 9 \n\nChapter 1. \nCHILDHOOD 9\n\nChapter 2. \nYOUTH 37 \n\nChapter 3. \nSTUDENT YEARS  54\n\nChapter 4. \nRETURN TO RUSSIA 90\n\nChapter 5. \nYEARS OF RESEARCH 127 \n\nChapter 6. \nS.
