Can't vouch for the content, as I haven't read it yet, but will soon. *** \n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nAs the battle rages over piracy, copyright, and the future of the Internet, which group argues on the right side of history? Searching for the truth, Freeloading roams the spunky streets of Brooklyn to glean real world consequences of digitization for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musicians, indie record labels and fans; then re-evaluates the pivotal controversies and ideas that have long dominated file-sharing debates, with a keen eye for practical solutions.\n\nFreeloading ranges from Napster to the SOPA blackout; Marshall McLuhan to Adam Smith; and the pitfalls of social media to how corporate patronage of Ã¢â‚¬Å“indieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ music spread as record sales sunk. It takes a critical, cool look at a near-pervasive phenomenon that involves almost everyone who taps a keyboard: beyond that, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reminder of the truism that for every action there are consequences. What happens when we pirate a favorite work of artÃ¢â‚¬â€a song, book, or movie? And as importantly: what, if anything, can or should be done about it?\n\nInternet piracy has created unlikely allies. On the one hand, there are original creators of content, including artists and corporate copyright holdersÃ¢â‚¬â€on the other, legions of freespirited consumers who see themselves in the hacker/OWS tradition.\n\nAuthor Chris Ruen, himself a former dedicated freeloader, came to understand how illegal downloads can threaten an entire artistic community after spending time with successful Brooklyn bands who had yet to make a significant profit on their popular music. The product of innumerable late-night, caffeine-fueled conversations and interviews with contemporary musicians such as Craig Finn of The Hold Steady, Ira Wolf Tuton of Yeasayer, and Kyp Malone of TV on the Radio, Freeloading not only dissects this ongoing battleÃ¢â‚¬â€casting a critical eye on the famous SOPA protests and the attendant rhetoricÃ¢â‚¬â€but proposes concise, practical solutions that provide protection to artists and consumers alike.\n\nPublication December 2012 Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 270 pages\nPaperback ISBN 978-1-935928-99-7 Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ebook ISBN 978-1-935928-02-7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e681f2c56d6fc4456db69b76a08eafd1bb189d3e","amp;dn":"Freeloading%3A+How+our+insatiable+appetite+for+free+content+starve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e681f2c56d6fc4456db69b76a08eafd1bb189d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,129,242,197,109,111,196,69,109,182,155,118,160,142,175,209,187,24,157,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
