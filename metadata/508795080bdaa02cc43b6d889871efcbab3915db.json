ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storm season and despite perfect conditions for massive waves, two boats prepare to head out into the Gulf for a competitive fishing derby that could net $250,000 each in just 10 days. Out at the fishing grounds, the weather turns with 20 ft. waves and freezing spray. Captain Casey Eads of the Irene H is forced to run and hide for cover but Ron pushes man and machine to their limits to try to bring home a record haul and a giant payday for the Sea Barb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508795080bdaa02cc43b6d889871efcbab3915db","amp;dn":"Deadly+Seas+s01e02+Gulf+of+Alaska+HDTV-Killers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508795080bdaa02cc43b6d889871efcbab3915db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,135,149,8,11,218,160,44,196,59,109,136,152,113,239,203,171,57,21,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
