This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nPrince debuts &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; (at number 36) and The Thompson Twins debut &quot;Doctor! Doctor!&quot; (at number 32).\n\nCasey tells how Tommy James recorded &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; at the age of 13, which flopped. Four years later a Pittsburg DJ revived it and it went to number 1.\n\nA listener wants to know if anybody who was a national talk-show host first, has ever hit the top 40. Casey says there was Mr. Allen, Mr. Douglas, and Mr Crane.\n\nCasey gives details of the only 2 times in chart history where a song has reached the number one spot, dropped off, reclaimed the number one spot, dropped off again, and then reclaimed the number one spot for a third time.\n\n40:    Music Time - Styx\n39:    Don't Walk Away - Rick Springfield\n38:    I Can Dream About You - Dan Hartman            \n37:    Whisper To A Scream (Birds Fly) - Icicle Works\n36:    When Doves Cry - Prince\n35:    No Way Out - Jefferson Starship\n34:    Rock You Like A Hurricane - The Scorpions\n33:    What Is Love - Howard Jones\nEXTRA: Hanky Panky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tommy James &amp; The Shondells\n32:    Doctor!
