Vern Cotter's side will be hoping to avenge the defeat they suffered the last time the teams met in November 2012 at Pittodrie. That match saw Tonga claim their first-ever victory over Scotland. Scotland's record cap holder and points scorer Chris Paterson will be among the studio guests, along with former international Mike Blair. John Beattie and Andy Nicol provide the commentary.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 7.88 GB\nRuntime___: 129 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps ~7831Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 192Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\nAudio#2___: MP2 256Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\n\nDropbox folder\nt i n y u r l . c o m / m s z 9 q 9 a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a414c8a5abdf1fa234a865f6679414f218a53016","amp;dn":"BBC.Rugby.Union.2014.11.22.Scotland.v.Tonga.1080ip.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a414c8a5abdf1fa234a865f6679414f218a53016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,20,200,165,171,223,31,162,52,168,101,246,103,148,20,242,24,165,48,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
