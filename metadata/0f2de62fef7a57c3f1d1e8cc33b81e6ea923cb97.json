The title story of this collection has been made into the Steven Spielberg-directed movie of the same name, while &quot;The Days of Perky Pat&quot; inspired one of Dick's greatest works, the novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch; The Penultimate Truth grew from &quot;The Mold of Yancy&quot;. Philip K. Dick is shown at his incomparable prime in this fourth volume of the definitive collection of short fiction.\n================\nRippers Notes\n=============\nI have joined together the stories that were spread across the\nCDs.  During the readings, you will hear about 30 seconds of\nmusic fade out and in.  This is where the CD breaks were.\nIt made logical sense to store the books this way.  If you\nprefer them in CD sized rips, I believe Sciguy has ripped them\nin that format.  Ask him to post them.\n\nBook Description\n================\nBook 1 The Minority Report - 90:01\nBook 2 We Can Remember It For You Wholesale (aka Total Recall) - 53:26\nBook 3 Paycheck - 82:45\nBook 4 Second Variety - 99:01\nBook 5 The Eyes Have It - 07:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2de62fef7a57c3f1d1e8cc33b81e6ea923cb97","amp;dn":"Philip+K+Dick+-+Minority+Report+And+Other+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2de62fef7a57c3f1d1e8cc33b81e6ea923cb97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,45,230,47,239,122,87,195,241,209,232,204,51,184,30,110,169,35,203,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
