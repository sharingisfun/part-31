The group is considered to be a pioneer of hard rock and heavy metal music along with Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, but the members refer to their music as &quot;rock 'n roll.&quot; More than three decades into a career that shows no signs of slowing down or letting up, AC/DC, like electricity itself, provides the world with an essential source of power and energy. Since forming in 1973, AC/DC's high voltage rock 'n' roll has flowed out into the world via consistently sold-out concert tours and global sales totaling more than 150 million albums and counting.\n\nThis is the ultimate critical review of a legendary band, from the early days when AC/DC rose from playing obscure clubs to conquering the world. For many fans, Bon Scott was a legendary frontman without equal, and his powerful voice was the key to a host of classic hits from Whole Lotta Rosie to Let There Be Rock. After his trgic death, the virtually unknown Brian Johnson stepped into the breach, and AC/DC came storming back with the classic album Back In Black.\n\n\nPart 2 : The Brian Johnson Era \n\nThe year was 1980, and AC/DC had just lost the legendary frontman Bon Scott. He had been the epitome of the hard rockin' sound the band made their own, and this would have been the end of the line for most. However, Brian Johnson was recruited and the band produced their most popular album Back In Black, selling over 40 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1285 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.720:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 1:16:45\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 854,980,608 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e900722a861ba09effacf83bce13d133947b4d0","amp;dn":"Classic.Rock.Productions.AC.DC.Music.In.Review.2of3.The.Brian.Jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e900722a861ba09effacf83bce13d133947b4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,144,7,34,168,97,186,9,239,250,207,131,188,225,61,19,57,71,180,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
