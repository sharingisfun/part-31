UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly\n  commpressed content. Also there seems to be the problemm with Haali Media\n  Splitter. If you are using Media Player Classic please make sure you have\n  enabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.\n2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. If you HAVE LIKED this\n  release tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell\n  why, so I could learn from your opinion providing you something better in the\n  future .\n3. I can confirm the xbox360 media center extender plays this movie with no\n  issues at all.\n4. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to\n  any existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine\n  and for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM QEBS releases. If the\n  scene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon\n  become like our goverments.\n5. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying\n  Bluray/DVD or any other possible way.\n6. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player\n  version 9 or higher.\n7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something\n  directly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size,\n  than the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan\n  - founders of FASM\n8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is the h264 commpression method\n  optimised directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved\n  , each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard\n  x264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than\n  DIVX3.\n9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.\n10.Any subtitles made for different releases but the same type (Bluray Rip) should\n  also work with this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d466462eb7b8022b9554a98f8e1d4e94e70c6e","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Wonderland+2010+eBDRip+QEBS+1080p+PS3-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d466462eb7b8022b9554a98f8e1d4e94e70c6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,212,102,70,46,183,184,2,43,149,84,169,143,142,29,78,148,231,12,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
