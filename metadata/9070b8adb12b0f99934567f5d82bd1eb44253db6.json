In thermal design of heat exchangers there are presently many stages in which assumptions in mathematical solution of the design problem are being made. Accumulation of these assumptions may introduce variations in design. The designer needs to understand where these inaccuracies may arise, and strive to eliminate as many sources of error as possible by choosing design configurations that avoid such problems at source.\nIn this exciting text, the author adopts a numerical approach to the thermal design of heat exchangers, extending the theory of performance evaluation to the point where computer software may be written. The first few chapters are intended to provide a development from undergraduate studies regarding the fundamentals of heat exchanger theory and the concepts of direct sizing. Later chapters on transient response of heat exchangers and on the related single-blow method of obtaining experimental results should also interest the practicing engineer. Theory is explained simply, with the intention that readers can develop their own approach to the solution of particular problems.\n\nThis book is an indispensable reference text for higher level (post-graduate) students and practicing engineers, researchers and academics in the field of heat exchangers.\n\nIncludes a whole new chapter on exergy and pressure loss\nProvides in the first few chapters a development from undergraduate studies regarding the fundamentals of heat exchanger theory, and continues in later chapters to discuss issues such as the transient response of heat exchangers and the related single-blow method of obtaining experimental results that are also of interest to the practicing engineer.\nAdopts a numerical approach to the thermal design of heat exchangers, extending the theory of performance evaluation to the point where computer software may be written\nContributes to the development of the direct Ã¢â‚¬ËœsizingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approach in thermal design of the exchanger surface\nExplains theory simply, with the objective that the reader can develop their own approach to the solution of particular problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9070b8adb12b0f99934567f5d82bd1eb44253db6","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Thermal+Design+of+Heat+Exchangers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9070b8adb12b0f99934567f5d82bd1eb44253db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,112,184,173,177,43,15,153,147,69,103,245,216,43,209,235,68,37,61,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
