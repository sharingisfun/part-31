The authors provide a general overview of the MATLAB language and its graphics abilities before delving into problem solving, making the book useful for readers without prior MATLAB experience. They explain how to generate code suitable for various applications so that readers can apply the techniques to problems not covered in the book. Examples, figures, and MATLAB scripts enable readers with basic mathematics knowledge to solve various applied math problems in their fields while avoiding unnecessary technical details","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97cc3510f76da3f444c8d8643aa6ffef183533c1","amp;dn":"Solving+Applied+Mathematical+Problems+with+MATLAB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97cc3510f76da3f444c8d8643aa6ffef183533c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,204,53,16,247,109,163,244,68,200,216,100,58,166,255,239,24,53,51,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
