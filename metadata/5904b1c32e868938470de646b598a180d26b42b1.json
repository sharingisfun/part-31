SEVERAL WILL DIE. The climax of four years of X-Men stories is the X-Event of 2010! What started in HOUSE OF M with the Decimation of mutantkind and erupted with the first new mutant birth in MESSIAH COMPLEX finishes here. In the epic crossover SECOND COMING, CyclopsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ faith pays off when Cable returns to the present with Hope, the girl he believes to be the mutant messiah. But will she be the savior or destroyer of mutantkind? We may never know, as she is the target of an initiative for mutant eradication unlike anything they X-Men have ever experienced. Many will be wounded. Several will die. Is Hope worth it?\n\n\nThis is a re-upload of the Second Coming event (if you haven't read it, read it)\nAll of these issues ARE in english.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5904b1c32e868938470de646b598a180d26b42b1","amp;dn":"X-Men%3A+Second+Coming+%2B+Tie+Ins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5904b1c32e868938470de646b598a180d26b42b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,4,177,195,46,134,137,56,71,13,230,70,181,152,161,128,210,107,66,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
