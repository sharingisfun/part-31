Almost all are my own scans; a few are improved versions of scans found on the web. By and large these are books not easily found in digital format elsewhere.\n\nThe topics are pretty random -- fiction, literature, politics, literary criticism, philosophy, esoteric, etc., etc. If you've liked many of my previous uploads, you'll probably find something to like in this one.\n\nPlease feel free to repost anything in this torrent anywhere you think others might find it.\n\n\nTitle - Author:\n\nAnother Day of Life - Ryszard Kapuscinski\nApplied Christianity - John J.
