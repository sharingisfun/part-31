It was the final episode of the 5th season in which &quot;The Tangled Web&quot; was introduced, which harkens back to Giacchino's love of John Williams' own fantasy scores. The melody takes a very large role in the subsequent season and has striking similarities to Williams' own theme for the Ark of the Covenant in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; with its mystical overtones and quasi-religious qualities.\n\nTotal duration: 1:18:21\n\nTrack listing\n 1  &quot;Making Up for Lost Time&quot;              3:23  &quot;Because You Left&quot;\n 2  &quot;The Swinging Bendulum&quot;                5:44  &quot;The Lie&quot;\n 3  &quot;Locke's Excellent Adventure&quot;          4:01  &quot;The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham&quot;\n 4  &quot;The Science of Faith&quot;                 2:19  &quot;316&quot;\n 5  &quot;More Locke Than Locke&quot;                3:15  &quot;316&quot;\n 6  &quot;Together or Not Together&quot;             4:03  &quot;316&quot;\n 7  &quot;Through the Window&quot;                   2:08  &quot;316&quot;\n 8  &quot;Dharma Delinquent&quot;                    1:52  &quot;LaFleur&quot;\n 9  &quot;La Fleur&quot;                             2:37  &quot;LaFleur&quot;\n10  &quot;Crash and Yearn&quot;                      2:30  &quot;Namaste&quot;\n11  &quot;Your Kharma Hit My Dharma&quot;            2:06  &quot;Whatever Happened, Happened&quot;\n12  &quot;Alex In Chains&quot;                       1:37  &quot;Dead Is Dead&quot;\n13  &quot;I Hear Dead People&quot;                   1:54  &quot;Some Like It Hoth&quot;\n14  &quot;For Love of the Dame&quot;                 3:18  &quot;The Variable&quot;\n15  &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;                    7:51  &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;\n16  &quot;Sawyer Jones and the Temple of Boom&quot;  5:16  &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;\n17  &quot;The Tangled Web&quot;                      1:42  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n18  &quot;Dharma Disaster&quot;                      5:18  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n19  &quot;Blessings and Bombs&quot;                  1:32  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n20  &quot;Jack's Swan Song&quot;                     1:16  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n21  &quot;Dharma vs. Lostaways&quot;                 4:24  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n22  &quot;The Incident&quot;                         3:09  &quot;The Incident&quot;\n23  &quot;Jacob's Stabber&quot;                      7:32  &quot;The Incident&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a0b148e11f86dbadd4134ca0e7d82f9f3b68b6","amp;dn":"Michael+Giacchino+-+Lost+Season+5+OST+%282010%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a0b148e11f86dbadd4134ca0e7d82f9f3b68b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,160,177,72,225,31,134,219,173,212,19,76,160,231,216,47,159,59,104,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
