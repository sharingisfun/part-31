Most of their singles had been rap remakes of old R&amp;B songs, and they hadn't even rapped all that much on their biggest hit, &quot;Push It,&quot; which got by on its catchy synth hook. \nBut Blacks' Magic was where Salt-N-Pepa came into their own. It wasn't that their crossover appeal diminished, but this time they worked from a funkier R&amp;B base that brought them more credibility among hip-hop and urban audiences. More importantly, they displayed a stronger group identity than ever before, projecting a mix of sassy, self-confident feminism and aggressive -- but responsible -- sexuality. The album's trio of hit singles -- &quot;Expression,&quot; &quot;Do You Want Me,&quot; and the playful safe-sex anthem &quot;Let's Talk About Sex&quot; -- summed up this new attitude and got the group plastered all over MTV. \nBut there was more to the album than just the singles -- track for track, Blacks' Magic was the strongest record Salt-N-Pepa ever released. Even if there's still a bit of filler here and there, Blacks' Magic successfully remade Salt-N-Pepa as their own women, and pointed the way to the even more commercially successful R&amp;B/pop/hip-hop fusions of Very Necessary.
