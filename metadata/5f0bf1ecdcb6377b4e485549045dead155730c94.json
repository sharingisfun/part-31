Die Reise (10:16)\n\nSaat is a little-known gem and Krautrock classic, an album full of dreamy and beautiful melodies. The Emtidi duo considerably expanded its instrumentation and style, and played a unique mix of folk, art rock, and psychedelic music. Besides acoustic guitar, the sound is mainly dominated by synthesizers, Mellotron, and other keyboard instruments, which are often played in a classical style. Some softly floating organ parts are comparable to early Tangerine Dream. In contrast stands a song like &quot;Love Time Rain,&quot; which could be written by the British folk band Pentangle. On most tracks, Dolly Holmes sings lead with her high, transfigured voice. Aside from &quot;Die Reise,&quot; a fairy tale story sung by Maik Hirschfeldt, all the songs have English lyrics. The album has a surprisingly full sound for a duo recording, although no drums were used. Most contemporary German bands played with new styles and sounds, but only a few obtained such wonderful music out of their experiments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0bf1ecdcb6377b4e485549045dead155730c94","amp;dn":"Emtidi+-+Saat+%5B1972%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0bf1ecdcb6377b4e485549045dead155730c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,11,241,236,220,182,55,123,78,72,85,73,4,93,234,209,85,115,12,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
