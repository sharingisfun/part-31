Now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got sequestration and shutdown. It appears that Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ keeps getting worse! Pretty soon our new normal will include sequestration, shutdown, and default. I think that the last time this sort of thing was considered Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ we were living in caves. The problem is that our new normal is being dictated by people like Ted Cruz and Mike LeeÃ¢â‚¬â€the most abnormal people in public life.\n\nIt looks like the House Republicans are going to keep trying to pass small bills piecemeal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see if any of it sticks, except that what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re throwing isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spaghetti.\n\nIt turns out that Grover Norquist is no fan of Ted Cruz. That means that the list of fans of Ted Cruz is down to Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. And Mike Lee is the kind of creepy, obsessed fan that should make Ted Cruz nervous. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure Ted Cruz is careful never to get into an elevator alone with Mike Lee, unless he really wants to have his face licked. Grover says that Ted Cruz Ã¢â‚¬Å“pushed House Republicans into traffic and wandered away.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As opposed to Grover Norquist, who tied Republicans up with his tax pledge and then left them in the middle of a highway divider.\n\nTed Cruz got blasted yesterday at a closed door meeting with fellow Republican legislators. Republicans blame Cruz for contributing to the mess that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in. Contributing? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the major donor! Ted Cruz is the Arthur Vining Davis of contributors to this mess! Cruz says that the media just loves to cover disagreements between Republicans. Actually, in this instance there seems to be pretty substantial agreementÃ¢â‚¬â€that Ted Cruz is a major jerk.\n\nThe very same Republicans who shut down the government have spent the week at the World War II memorial, grandstanding against the government shutdown! You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even say that these people have no shame. They have plenty of shameÃ¢â‚¬â€their just totally unaware of it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:703746c43978b9387d05bfcea621fa481d24d61c","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+03+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"703746c43978b9387d05bfcea621fa481d24d61c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,55,70,196,57,120,185,56,125,5,191,206,166,33,250,72,29,36,214,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
