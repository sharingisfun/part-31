Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two big renovation projects, and the brothers only have four weeks to transform the house as promised. But Connie's short fuse ignites whenever Jonathan discovers unexpected flaws: the hardwood in the games room is damaged, the walls need a skim coat but she refuses to compromise, and Jonathan's walking on eggshells around her. Even TV placement becomes a major issue. When the couple is forced to move out of their old house and into the reno, they declare the work site a war zone and it's every man for himself!\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d0839b7db5947be7aacac074fc610925fb73a1d","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e07.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d0839b7db5947be7aacac074fc610925fb73a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,8,57,183,219,89,71,190,122,172,172,7,79,198,16,146,95,183,58,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
