Did the American Indians descend from the inhabitants of an alien spacecraft that crashed in the Alaska-Canada region thousands of years ago? Keepers of the Garden told the story of the original seeding of the planet Earth by aliens from outerspace. Starcrash indicates that aliens continue to come to Earth, some intentionally and some by accident, throughout our history. In order to adjust to harsh conditions, they were forced to interbreed with the local aborigines. This was the only way to ensure the survival of their race. Does their blood still flow in the veins of certain American Indian tribes? Dolores Cannon, hypnotist and psychic investigator, researches this unique case of past-life regression.\n\nISBN: 0-9632776-7-7.............250pp.,paper\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.

Her roots in hypnosis go back to the 1960s. She has been specializing in past-life therapy since 1979.\n\nDolores has become, perhaps, the world's most unlikely expert on the prophecies of Nostradamus. A retired Navy wife from Huntsville, AR, USA, Dolores was nearly fifty years old when she began experimenting with hypnosis and past-life regression. The results were, to say the least, quite spectacular!\n\nWorking through several different subjects, Dolores was able to establish communication with the living Michel De Notredame, better known as the prophet, Nostradamus. His revelations and their impact on our own time are both fascinating and at times frightening.\n\nDolores has written the three volume set &quot;Conversations With Nostradamus&quot;, the series on the translation of Nostradamus' quatrains. This series contains the translation of almost 1000 prophecies, all interpreted for the first time and have been in print since 1989. It is considered the most accurate interpretation of the prophecies ever printed.\n\nDolores has been a UFO investigator for twenty years, using her skills as a regressionist to help people that had been involved in abduction cases. She has written several books on the UFO information volunteers have revealed while under hypnosis.\n\nDolores is now teaching her unique technique of hypnosis all over the world.\n\nIn addition to the three volumes of &quot;Converstations With Nostradamus&quot;, Dolores has completed:&quot;The Legend of Starcrash&quot;, &quot;Keepers of the Garden&quot;, &quot;Legacy from the Stars&quot;, &quot;A Soul Remembers Hiroshima&quot;, &quot;They Walked With Jesus&quot;, &quot;Jesus and the Essenes&quot; and &quot;Between Death and Life&quot;. &quot;The Custodians&quot;, discusses in detail information regarding distorted time, screen memories, reasons for abductions, implants and much, much more....\n\nHer latest book, &quot;The Convoluted Universe, Book One&quot;, goes further into complex metaphysical theories and covers &quot;mind-bending&quot; concepts.\n\nOther books dealing with more of her most interesting hypnosis cases are forthcoming.\n\nDolores has been touring in the USA, England, Europe, the former Soviet countries, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia to promote her works, and to discuss her particular brand of psychic research. She has spoken to radio and television audiences worldwide.
