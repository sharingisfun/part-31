There's not a weak note here, and all of its has a harder, more muscular sound courtesy of Kemp and Johnson, matched to impeccable vocals and uniformly excellent material. Kemp's bass playing makes it possible to overlook the absence of a drummer, while the match-up of Johnson and Hart made them one of the best electric guitar teams in English folk-rock (and helps explain Steeleye's successful eclipsing of the post-Richard Thompson Fairport Convention). Prior's voice was never better than on this album, and while Carthy's backing vocals are missed, the group's singing is still up to a very high standard, with &quot;Rosebud in June&quot; perhaps the best a cappella number in their repertory and &quot;Royal Forester&quot; their most charmingly lusty performance. &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; -- which every Traffic fan should hear -- is in a class by itself, and the dazzling &quot;Gaudette&quot; actually made the British charts and got Steeleye Span onto Top of the Pops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ff9cdd1cf34f2620a99587ea121959f7aaf2e7","amp;dn":"Steeleye+Span+-+Below+the+Salt+%5B1972%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ff9cdd1cf34f2620a99587ea121959f7aaf2e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,255,156,221,28,243,79,38,32,169,149,135,234,18,25,89,247,170,242,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
