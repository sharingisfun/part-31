Somehow, these 26 abstract building blocksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½each with its own\nunique arrangement of lines, curves, or dotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½work together in endless combinations\nto represent ideas. We need to copy these forms clearly and consistently in order to record our thoughts on paper in a way that others can understand.\nWe all know the pride young students (and their teachers and family members!)\ntake in their first attempts at writing these forms and in the important steps they take in kindergarten and first grade on the way to becoming writers. Children are highly motivated to learn to write.\n\nBut how do we keep that sense of wonder, that joy of getting lost in the letters\nalive as second and third graders take on the new challenge of writing in cursive?\nNurturing a love of writing is one of the many things teachers already do; how\ncan we integrate this new form of written communication into our work and create\nanother strong, fun diving board from which children can jump into the exhilarating\npool of literacy?\n\nWelcome to Cursive Writing Made Easy and Fun!\n\nCurvy letters, script, fancy writing, grown-up lettersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no matter what students call it, cursive is a writing system that requires practice to learn.

Coupled\nwith their strong desire to learn to write like adults or older brothers and sisters,\nlearning cursive is a motivational building block for studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ future literacy development: when students enjoy putting pencil to paper, and see their writing as a form of individual expression, they are more likely to do more of it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebdadfa888140df89a61979014d1078b26560860","amp;dn":"Cursive+Writing+Made+Easy+%26amp%3B+Fun.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebdadfa888140df89a61979014d1078b26560860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,218,223,168,136,20,13,248,154,97,151,144,20,209,7,139,38,86,8,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
