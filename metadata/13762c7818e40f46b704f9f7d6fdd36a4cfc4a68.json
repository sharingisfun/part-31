C. Sippy and written and directed by Gulzar. It was Gulzar's first directorial venture and was almost a frame by frame remake of the National Award winning Bengali film Apanjan, which was directed by Tapan Sinha.\n\nAnandi Devi (Meena Kumari) is an old widow who lives in a village. One day she is visited by a distant relative, Arun Gupta (Ramesh Deo), who persuades her to live in town with him, his wife Lata (Sumita Sanyal), and a small child. She later realizes that they were looking for a maid which results in her expulsion from the house and befriending a child beggar who takes her to his dilapidated home. Being good-natured and caring, she slowly earns the title of 'Nani Ma' (maternal grandmother) among groups of youths led by Shyam (Vinod Khanna) and Chaino (Shatrughan Sinha) who were in constant fight with each other. The movie ends with her death from an accidental gun fire in one such clash.\n\nThis movie has some melodious songs:\n&quot;Koi Hota Jisko Apna&quot;...Kishore Kumar\n&quot;Haal Chal Theek Thak Hai&quot;...Kishore Kumar, Mukesh\n&quot;Roz Akeli Aayi&quot;...Lata Mangeshkar\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067421/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067421/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nMeena Kumari as Anandi Devi\nDeven Verma as Niranjan\nVinod Khanna as Shyam\nShatrughan Sinha as Chaino\nAsrani as Raghunath\nDanny Denzongpa as Sanju\nPaintal as Bansi\nDinesh Thakur as Billoo\nSudhir Thakkar as Ranbir\nRamesh Deo as Arun Gupta\nSumita Sanyal as Lata\nMehmood as Sri Anokhelal\nAsit Sen as Biloki Prasad\nAbhi Bhattacharya as Freedom Fighter\nLeela Mishra as Gupta's maidservant\nShashi Kiran as Neelu\nKeshto Mukherjee as Jattu\nDev Kishan as Shyam's father\nA.
