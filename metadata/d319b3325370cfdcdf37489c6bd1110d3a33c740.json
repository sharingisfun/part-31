They have banned computers and robots in an attempt to insure &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic stability&quot;. When a Unicom Synth robot infiltrates a southwest TV station and kills the manager, a revolutionary against the gestapo-like corporation, a lowly Unicom delivery man must help the rest of the station survive through the incoming &quot;thermal storm&quot;.\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tShit goes down at remote TV station. People die, blood and boobs appear, a giant robot climaxes.\n\n-Notes-\nFor some reason I&amp;#039;ve had this one for a long time and haven&amp;#039;t posted it. That being said, its been a few months since I&amp;#039;ve seen it, but its quality, even just for Bill Moseley himself. All in all, actually not a terrible film it has its moments, but its plenty entertaining!\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Crash.and.Burn.VHSCapture.LRH.avi\nFilesize.....: 697 MB (or 714,132 KB or 731,271,168 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:24:27 (151,859 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1078 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 69 kb/s (34/ch, stereo) VBR \nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\n\n*QUESTIONS*\nWhy is the resolution so small?\n...That&amp;#039;s as high as my capture card will go.
