However, a hero defeated the device and a great seal was laid over The Machine. In 2707, the depleted world is ruled by four Corporations: Mishima, Bauhaus, Capitol and Imperial that are in constant war. During a battle between Capitol and Bauhaus, the great seal is broken and The Machine works again transforming soldiers and civilians in hordes of mutants. A small part of the population escapes to Mars, leaving millions of people behind. The man of faith and leader of an ancient brotherhood Brother Samuel is a believer of God and the Chronicles, a bible about the mutants. With the city under siege of the mutants, he visits the Corporations'leader Constantine asking for an aircraft and twenty men for a suicide mission to destroy The Machine, planting a bomb and a detonator following the knowledge of the Chronicles. He recruits the tough Major 'Mitch' Hunter; the Bauhaus Lieutenant Maximillian von Steiner; the keeper of the Chronicles Severian that is under a vow of silence; the gorgeous and lethal Corporal Valerie Duval; Corporal Juba Kim Wu; Captain John McGuire; and Corporal\nJesus 'El Jesus' de Barrera. Together they become the last hope of Earth against the evil mutants.\n\nBurn Tested...............: Yes\nMovie Runtime.............: 1:46:53\n\nAudio Format..............: Dolby Digital\nEncoder...................: AC3\nChannels..................: 6\n\nVideo Format..............: Xvid\nStandalone Support........: ESS\nResolution................: 720 x 384\nSource....................: Retail DVD\nOriginal Format...........: Pal\n\ncredit BlueLady BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e301ba53695ad313b31e16af47272d3df066fdc","amp;dn":"Mutant+Chronicles+LTD+UncutEdition+DVDRipXvidAC3+RoCK%26BlueLadyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e301ba53695ad313b31e16af47272d3df066fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,48,27,165,54,149,173,49,59,49,225,106,244,114,114,211,223,6,111,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
