His jealous nurse kills herself when the prince falls for the native woman in this underplayed drama. Insights into Cambodian culture add greatly to the understanding and motives for the characters in the film.\n\nDirector: King Norodom Sihanouk\nSpoken language: French, Khmer\nSubtitles: Hardcoded English (and hard to see at times...)\n\n\nRather bad quality, but it is as good as it gets from Russian Market...\n\n\n\n\n\nJust do a search for ASIANTORRENTS and you'll find all the movies\npreviously posted by me and others that has this tag (about 170).\n(Do you too post asian movies? Copy-paste this part to your posts!)\n************************************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd338b8e11c4146b41b70e31ee742f102897728","amp;dn":"Twilight+%28Cambodia+1969+-+King+Norodom+Sihanouk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd338b8e11c4146b41b70e31ee742f102897728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,211,56,184,225,28,65,70,180,27,112,227,30,231,66,241,2,137,119,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
