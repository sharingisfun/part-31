R E L E A S E  N O T E S ..\n\nRecent recipient of the lauded &quot;Best Newcomer&quot;\nmantle in DJ Mag's 2010 awards, joint head of\nthe Numbers empire, and all-round good egg,\nJackmaster heads up his first commercially\navailable mix CD, 'Fabriclive 57'. It's a\nproper party session, heavily informed by an\nabiding love of '90s dance classics and\nunderground American funk, coupled with a\npenchant for the most virulent emissions of\nthe current UK scene. These are all BIG\nrecords, starting with one foot in the '80s\nelectrofunk of The Fantastic Aleems 'Release\nYourself' before stepping into the Juan Atkins\nfix of 'Big Fun'. He's got you by the short\nand curlies at this point, segueing a path\nthrough the likes of Model 500's 'Night\nDrive', Armand Van Helden's deadly mix of Kim\nEnglish on 'Nite Life', Anthony Shakir's\n'Plugged In', an exclusive Martyn joint\n'Alldayallnight' and the bubbling SocaXFunky\nof Geiom's '2 4 6'. In the mid section he\ncruises through Jook 10's London House anthem\n'Emotions', Larry Heard's 'Sun Can't Compare',\nAddison Groove's 'Make Um Bounce' and Davina's\nMad Mike-produced piano Houser 'Don't You Want\nIt', to an outstanding run of CLS's 'Can You\nFeel It', DJ Deeon's 'The Freaks' and The\nOutlander's 'Vamp' for the hardcore House\nheads. The final flush features some priceless\nclassics, from UR's 'Jupiter Jazz' to Thomas\nBangaltar's 'What To Do', onto AFX's\nheart-swelling 'VBS.Redlof.B' meshed with\nSkepta's 'Doin It Again' and closing to the\ntear-jerking strains of Radiohead's anthemic\n'Idioteque'. As you can gauge, these aren't\nobscure joints, but the DJ magic lies in his\nintuitively programmed drops and pacing,\nmaking for a party mix you'll reach for over\nand again. Respect also for not just pulling\nout a cache of whites and exclusives, instead\nopting for a classic selection that'll no\ndoubt introduce a ruck of heads to important\ndance classics, and still sound good a decade\nfrom now.
