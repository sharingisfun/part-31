Garry spent just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he did the regular cast members, offering up opening monologues and show-closing summations of the episode's events. On Garry's show, all the supporting characters knew they were on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience was often in the storyline - on one episode, Garry invited them to make themselves at home after he left the scene (they ended up throwing a raucous party); in another, a surprise birthday party for Garry's mom went awry when the audience's shout of &quot;surprise!&quot; caused her to have a heart attack. One memorable episode saw Garry move out of town, with his apartment (and show) taken over by Red Buttons; when he tried to return, his friends admitted they liked Red better. The show introduced much of the country to Shandling and paved the way for his more successful run as late-night talk show host Larry Sanders on HBO's The Larry Sanders Show.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Garry_Shandling's_Show\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090459/\n\nCreators: Garry Shandling and Alan Zweibel.\nWriters: Garry Shandling, Alan Zweibel, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Ed Solomon, Elaine Aronson, Larry Levin, Sam Simon, Jeff Franklin, Janis Hirsch, Patricia Rust, Richard Day, John Bowman, and Monica Mcgowan Johnson.\nDirectors: Alan Rafkin, Thomas Schlamme, Art Wolff, Don Mischer, Roy London, David Steinberg, and Paul Miller.\nStarring: Garry Shandling, Dan Aykroyd, Paul Winfield, Molly Cheek, Michael Tucci, Scott Nemes, Paul Willson, Bernadette Birkett, Barbara Cason, Ian Buchanan, Jessica Harper, Bruno Kirby, Richard Fancy, Roy Brocksmith, Danny Dayton, Chi Ngo, Geoffrey Blake, Rob Reiner, Tom Petty, Paul Feig, Martin Mull, Kate Mulligan, Don Novello, Jay Kogen, Todd Baker, Carl Reiner, Shawn Southwick, Blake Clark, Edie Adams, Jason Bernard, Jennifer Tilly, Dave Coulier, Christine Kellogg, Chuck Woolery, Red Buttons, Don Amendolia, Joy Behar, Bert Convy, Stuart Pankin, Steve Allen, Brandon Crane, Chevy Chase, and Dabney Coleman.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (verson # 0.8.6f): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 -

But, if you want, you can get Friends and That 70's Show on DVD. Ah, yes, there's nothing like a self-imposed censorship of massive, industry giants, telling us what we're allowed to think, allowed to watch, allowed to talk about. And even for those DVDs that are available, they cost over 5,000% of what the product cost to make -- $0.03 for the plastic, $9.96 for some fat-cat, millionaire who sits behind a desk for four hours a day playing solitaire. And I guess some of that cash trickles down the chain of command to the lawyers who keep our artists poor, abused, mistreated, and exploited. With piracy, at least we, the working class and the people, have some power to grant ourselves both some more liberty and a greater share of the fruits of our labors. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Viva la comuna! Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Muerte a los jefes!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Two.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ff69b19e71ac924554e4ab0b99852d557dfa21","amp;dn":"It%5C%27s+Garry+Shandling%5C%27s+Show+-+Seasons+1-4+%2B+Extras+%28Comple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ff69b19e71ac924554e4ab0b99852d557dfa21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,255,105,177,158,113,172,146,69,84,228,171,11,153,133,45,85,125,250,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
