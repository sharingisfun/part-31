Stirred to action by the atrocities she witnessed, she joined forces with several colleagues to form an organized resistance-very likely the first such group to fight back against the occupation. (In fact, their newsletter, RÃƒÂ©sistance, gave the French Resistance its name.) \nIn the throes of their struggle for freedom, the members of Humbert's group were betrayed to the Gestapo; Humbert herself was imprisoned. In immediate, electrifying detail, Humbert describes her resistance against the Nazis, her time in prison, and the horrors she endured in a string of German labor camps, always retaining-in spite of everything-hope for herself, for her friends, and for humanity. Originally published in France in 1946, the book is now translated into English for the first time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ebdf64b80372c171a4b37b1b8577eec2ee75ce","amp;dn":"Agnes+Humbert+-+R%26eacute%3Bsistance+%28Occupied+France%29+%5B96%5D+Unabrid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ebdf64b80372c171a4b37b1b8577eec2ee75ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,235,223,100,184,3,114,193,113,164,179,123,27,133,119,238,194,238,117,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
