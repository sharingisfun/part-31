King William III had taken England into a disastrous war against the most powerful country in Europe. If England was to survive, it needed a new Navy, one capable of carrying the fight to its enemies anywhere in the world.\n\nTo achieve this would require a national effort unlike anything that had been seen before. King William III's determination to achieve mastery of the seas unleashed a chain reaction of revolutions in finance, industry and agriculture which reshaped the landscape and created the country's first great credit boom. Fifty years before the Industrial Revolution, the Royal Navy became the engine of global change, propelling Britain into the modern world.\n\nIt had the desired effect at sea. By 1759, French forces around the world were capitulating to Britain's superior Navy. For the first time in her history, Britannia really did rule the waves.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.0\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59 minutes\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.70GB\nSubtitles: merged\nRipped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b532eb9e8d3b966b5315194e43a0e1d28e224e6","amp;dn":"BBC+Empire+of+the+Seas+2of4+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b532eb9e8d3b966b5315194e43a0e1d28e224e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,83,46,185,232,211,185,102,181,49,81,148,228,58,14,29,40,226,36,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
