You are guided to search for those desires that can bring you true happiness, leading to deeper insight into yourself and the development of higher wisdom.\n\nYou will learn how to channel energy, that is normally dissipated by too many desires, into something meaningful and fulfilling.\n\nYou do this by creating a statement of intent (a sankalpa) that summarizes the one desire that is most important for you, your heart's desire.\n\nBy repeating your sankalpa in your meditation and creating a plan of action to achieve it, you begin to fully realize that you are the co-creator of your own life. You are the motivating force behind your own dreams and you have what it takes to realize them.\n\nTracks\n\n01 Talk on Desire\n02 Witnessing Desires\n03 Desires and the Chakras\n04 Your Heart's Desire\n\nTitle: Illuminating Your Heart's Desire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Finding Your Life's Purpose (Sankalpa)\nAuthor: Swami Shankardev Saraswati and Jayne Stevenson\nPublisher: Big Shakti\nContent: Introductory Talk and Guided Meditation Techniques\nMedia: MP3\nDuration: 80 minutes\n\n192 kbs - MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d09c8c32d2166af44d601e8f6e1a211a714ecf9","amp;dn":"Illuminating+Hearts+Desire+%28Yoga+%26amp%3B+Meditation+Body-Mind+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d09c8c32d2166af44d601e8f6e1a211a714ecf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,9,200,195,45,33,102,175,68,214,1,232,246,225,162,17,167,20,236,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
