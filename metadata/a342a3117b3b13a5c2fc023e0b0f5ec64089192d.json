He has taught his thinking methods to government agencies, corporate clients, organisations and individuals, privately or publicly in group sessions. He has started to set up the World Center for New Thinking, based in Malta, which he describes as a &quot;kind of intellectual Red Cross&quot;.\n\nIn 1995, he created the futuristic documentary film, 2040: Possibilities by Edward de Bono, a lecture designed to prepare an audience of viewers released from a cryogenic freeze for contemporary (2040) society.\n\nDe Bono has developed a range of 'deliberate thinking techniques' - which emphasise thinking as a deliberate act.\n\nDe Bono's techniques are used in companies like IBM, DuPont.
