Each arc will be done by a different creative team and focus on a different &quot;fairest of the land&quot;.  This first arc is written by Bill Willingham himself, with art by Phil Jiminez.\nBoth c2c and noAds versions are provided.\n*Note: I plan to release update torrents after the conclusion of each Fairest story arc in the future.\n========================================================\n\n\nNew York Times best-selling, award-winning creator Bill Willingham turns the spotlight on the female FABLES--spinning secret histories of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, Snow White, Rose Red and others. They may be beautiful, but there will be blood.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for these scans.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8754d344c57949362b258f5bab68cf86bd7d6f9","amp;dn":"Fairest+01-07+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8754d344c57949362b258f5bab68cf86bd7d6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,117,77,52,76,87,148,147,98,178,88,245,186,182,140,248,107,215,214,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
