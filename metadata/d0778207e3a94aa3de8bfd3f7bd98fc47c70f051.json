It is usually classified under the acid-jazz and funk genre.\n\n\nimage Review:\nThe Return of the Space Cowboy is the second album by the band Jamiroquai. Released in 1994, it is usually classified under the acid-jazz and funk genre. One odd but very unique song on the album is &quot;Space Cowboy&quot;, it is said to be a &quot;cannabis apology&quot;. This album has become somewhat uncommon in the United States but remains a classic in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Many consider it to be the best and most refined example of the unique Jamiroquai sound.\nFollowing up a debut, &quot;Emergency On Planet Earth&quot;, that bubbled over with soul, funk and outrageous acid-jazz rhythms, &quot;Return Of The Space Cowboy&quot; brings the tempo down a notch, without losing any of its funky musical edge (or any of its idealistic lyrical flow). Singer Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Kay's vocals maintain the smooth manner of Stevie Wonder and Al Green, as demonstrated on &quot;Stillness In Time,&quot; which evokes the Brazilian grooves of Antonio Carlos Jobim, and on the quiet-storm-like title track.\nLest this become a totally low-key affair, a handful of tracks guarantee Jamiroquai isn't faking the funk. &quot;The Kids&quot; opens up the band's sound with greasy wah-wah guitar, punchy horns and a bouncy Moog syunthesizer.&quot;Light Years&quot; mix in equal amounts Parliament-Funkadelic and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, guaranteeing hours of head-bopping and toe-tapping.\nReview by Mark Stebbing\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1\n01.
