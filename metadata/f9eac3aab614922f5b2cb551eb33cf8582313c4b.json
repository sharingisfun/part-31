It's colored very strangely, very idiosyncratic. No consistency from page to page. Also, the original scans were very washed out and there was a ton of bleed through on some of the pages (so bad that I couldn't get rid of it 100% on a few of them). The 'Restoration' took so long and was so frustrating that I almost gave up on these Concrete books altogether. Instead I just put them to the side for a week and came back to them again this evening. I think they're passable, but they definitely don't look as good as the rest of the books.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9eac3aab614922f5b2cb551eb33cf8582313c4b","amp;dn":"Concrete+-+Fragile+Creatures+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9eac3aab614922f5b2cb551eb33cf8582313c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,234,195,170,182,20,146,47,91,44,181,81,235,51,207,133,130,49,60,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
