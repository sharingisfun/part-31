What makes the night special is that the band was backed up by a full symphony orchestra. The group performs three sets of songs that night, one high-energy traditional rock and roll show, a more sedate acoustic set, and finally a series of songs with backing from the classically trained musicians. The twenty-two song setlist includes such all time favorites as &quot;Beth,&quot; &quot;Deuce,&quot; &quot;Strutter,&quot; &quot;Detroit Rock City,&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\nDVD1\n01.
