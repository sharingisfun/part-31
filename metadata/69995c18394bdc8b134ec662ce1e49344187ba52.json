Released under Creative Commons (Non-Commercial-Share Alike), they want you to download and to take a listen. You're not going to regret it.\n\n\nContact: the_brightsparks(at)hotmail.co.uk\nMySpace:\nXFM Uploaded: http://www.xfmuploaded.co.uk/thebrightsparks\n\n\n** uploaded my www.manchestersound.org - download, listen, enjoy, share **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69995c18394bdc8b134ec662ce1e49344187ba52","amp;dn":"The+Brightsparks+-+Place+Your+Bets+%5BIndie-Pop-Upbeat%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69995c18394bdc8b134ec662ce1e49344187ba52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,153,92,24,57,75,220,139,19,78,198,98,206,30,73,52,65,135,186,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
