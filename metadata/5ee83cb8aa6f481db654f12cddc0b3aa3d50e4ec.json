They recorded two studio albums, Seven Turns and Shades of Two Worlds. Shades of Two Worlds was their best studio album since Brothers and Sisters. For some reason, it is no longer available. \n\nAfter Shades of Two Worlds, the Allman Brothers went on tour in 1991, and what a surprise! The old songs are played in new and exciting ways. Blue Skies and Melissa have great guitar duets. Southbound is played in a funky manner. The instrumental part of Dreams builds to a searing conclusion. The new songs are great. End of the Line is a 15 minute tour de force. \n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee83cb8aa6f481db654f12cddc0b3aa3d50e4ec","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers+Band+-+An+Evening+WithThe+Allman+Brothers_1992_2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee83cb8aa6f481db654f12cddc0b3aa3d50e4ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,232,60,184,170,111,72,29,182,84,241,44,221,192,179,170,61,80,228,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
