Philip Yano, the son of the Japanese officer who commanded the bunker on Iwo Jima where Swagger's marine father won the Medal of Honor in 1945, approaches Swagger about a missing sword wielded by his father, Hideki, during the battle for the island. The sword turns out to be not just a family heirloom but a national treasure that evokes echoes from the most sacrosanct corners of Japanese history. Yano's search reveals there are those who will gladly kill for the honor it bestows upon the possessor. Plunged into a Japan where honor and loyalty outweigh even one's own life, Swagger finds that an old warrior like himself still has much to understand. While the action builds to the inevitable climax, the joy of the journey will keep readers turning the pages. (Sept.)\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until now, Earl and Bob have each starred in their own books, but this time, ingeniously, Hunter brings them together when Bob is contacted by a retired Japanese soldier, Philip Yano, who believes that his father's samurai sword may have wound up in Earl's hands after the war. Bob tracks down the sword, travels to Japan, and presents it to YanoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after which the Yano family is slaughtered. Bob could walk away, but, of course, he doesn't. Throwing himself into samurai culture, he learns swordsmanship from a master and sets off to avenge the YanosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, in a sense, his father. Sure, this sounds clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d, but much of Hunter's genius comes from his ability to manipulate archetypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially the classic western scenario of the lone avengerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½drawing on the almost subconscious pull these themes exert on the reader but always infusing them with multiple layers of complexity. As Bob is drawn into the samurai world, and tension builds to the inevitable confrontation with his adversaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a modern samurai seduced by the dark sideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Hunter simultaneously fuels our need for bloody resolution and reveals the horrors wrought by devotion to honor and duty. But this time he does it with parallel narrativesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½juxtaposing the story of Earl Swagger and Philip Yano's father against the contemporary drama and playing off the same themes across generations. This is probably Hunter's most violent novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and that's saying somethingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but violence may have never been more integral to story than it is here. Hunter celebrates the samurai soldier while showing the appalling underside of the samurai way of life and the ideals that drive it.
