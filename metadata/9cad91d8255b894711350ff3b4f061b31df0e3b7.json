The success which will follow will give to the group the desire for creating a project in parallel: CHAOSTAR.\n\nChristos Antoniou, student for a long time in the largest universities of music in England, is the initiator of this new formation centered on the mixture of the classical music and the experimental music.\n\nAll the type-setters of Septicflesh take part in the development of the compositions but Christos reigns as a Master and orchestra with as much of brilliance of the musicians resulting from a Metal set than of a Classique set.\n\nThe result of this timeless confrontation will give rise to a music rich in seizing and destabilizing emotions.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nCurrent line-up\nChristos Antoniou - Samplers, Guitar (TheDevilWorx, Septicflesh)\nSapfo Stavridou - Vocals\nTania Nikoloudi - Backing Vocals\nBasia Lakoumenta - Backing Vocals\nFormer/past member(s)\nNatalie Rassoulis - Soprano Vocals (Septicflesh)\nSotiris Vayenas - Guitar (Danse Macabre (Bel), Raism, Septicflesh)\nSpiros Antoniou - Bass, Vocals (TheDevilWorx, Septicflesh)\n\nGenre: Ambient/Dark/Gothic/Neoclassical/Symphonic | Release dates: 2000-2007 | County: Greece (Athens/Attica) | Audio codec: MP3 320 kbps CBR | Duration: 03:19:09\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nTracklist\n\n2000-Chaostar\n\n01.
