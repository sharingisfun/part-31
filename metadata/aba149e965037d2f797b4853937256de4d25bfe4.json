The four-part series Planet Egypt delves deep into crucial periods in the history of the Pharaohs. The documentary depicts the founding of the Empire under King Narmer, the rise of Egypt to a world power under Thutmose III, the revolution during the reign of Akhenaten and the enormous surge in construction activity under Pharaoh Ramses the Great. By means of dramatic re-enactments and lavish computer animations, Terra-X resurrects the world of Ancient Egypt. Entire cities such as Hierakonpolis, Thebes and Amarna are reconstructed in 3-D animations and brought back to life. Each episode sheds light on one of the vital foundation stones at the base of this extraordinary civilisation.\n\n\n1)  Episode 1: Birth of the Empire \nThe history of Egypt is one of unparalleled success. But how was the Kingdom of Egypt united in the first place? To solve the mystery of how Egypt was born, we follow archaeologists as they examine the very beginning of the rule of the Pharaohs. It's the time now known as &quot;Dynasty Zero&quot; - Egypt's pre-dynastic period - a previously little known episode that sets Egypt on course for some of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. The film discovers that, through both war and peace, it was the mysterious King Narmer who laid the foundations for the continuing rule of the Pharaohs - a success story lasting more than 3000 years.\n\n2)  Episode 2: Pharaohs at War \nFor centuries the Pharaohs managed to shield Egypt from the outside world. But in the second millennia BC, foreign tribes began to infiltrate the north. From now on, foreign kings would regularly threaten the Nile Kingdom. How did the Egyptians go about defending themselves against their rivals? What were the military secrets behind the Egyptian success story? The film focuses on one of the most brilliant war leaders of Antiquity: Thutmose III. He employed new weapons technology and a standing army to expand the Empire. After defeating his neighbours, he shrewdly entered into alliances with them, thus securing Egypt's borders for centuries to come.\n\n3)  Episode 3: Temples of Power \nEgypt without is unimaginable without its gods. Over the course of centuries, the priests steadily gained in power - until the year 1350 BC, when King Akhenaten comes to the throne. He breaks with the cult that has kept the country together for more than 1500 years. He sweeps away the power of the priesthood and their temples. It is the greatest cultural revolution in the history of Egypt. The old imperial God Amun is banned - a challenge to the religious tradition underpinning the Egyptian civilization. This episode depicts the dramatic rise and fall of Akhenaten and the central role religion played in the 3000-year success story of the Pharaohs.\n\n4)  Episode 4: Quest for Eternity \nFrom the days of the first Pharaoh's tombs to the end of their era, Egyptians were united by one burning desire: to extend their lives to all eternity. This is why they built the gigantic pyramids, the splendid temples and the magnificent tombs that have become the hallmark of their civilization. To unravel the secrets of this seemingly morbid obsession with death, episode 4 of Planet Egypt examines Egypt's most elaborate tomb builder - Ramses the Great. The film discovers how the ancient Egyptians crafted an intricate balance between the world of the living and what lies beyond. Strange as it seems, Egypt's celebration of death holds the secret to the culture's longevity\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9839/planetegyptscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9839/planetegyptscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/1055/planetegyptscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/1055/planetegyptscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/9721/planetegyptscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/9721/planetegyptscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/1145/planetegyptscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/1145/planetegyptscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1250/planetegyptscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1250/planetegyptscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7306/planetegyptscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7306/planetegyptscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5910/planetegyptscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5910/planetegyptscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9712/planetegyptscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9712/planetegyptscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2954/planetegyptscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2954/planetegyptscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1741 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.781 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 641 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldscreen.com/worldscreenings/display/7955&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldscreen.com/worldscreenings/display/7955&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mysteries%20of%20Egypt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Mysteries%20of%20Egypt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ancient%20Egypt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ancient%20Egypt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Hidden%20History%20of%20Egypt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Hidden%20History%20of%20Egypt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Great%20Egyptians&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Great%20Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Egypt%27s%20New%20Tomb%20Revealed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Egypt%27s%20New%20Tomb%20Revealed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Engineering%20Egypt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Engineering%20Egypt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n3)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHarry65&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Planet_Egypt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Planet_Egypt&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba149e965037d2f797b4853937256de4d25bfe4","amp;dn":"SBS+Planet+Egypt+2of4+Pharaohs+at+War+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba149e965037d2f797b4853937256de4d25bfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,161,73,233,101,3,125,47,121,123,72,83,147,114,86,222,77,37,191,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
