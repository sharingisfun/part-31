I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always known this was going to be the path \nthat would bring me to a complexion I was proud of. I spent almost \na decade prior trying to get rid of my imperfections and breakouts \nthrough topical medications (from three different dermatologists), \nmail order systems, and years expensive over the counter creams. \nBut none of them cleared up my skin for good, my breakouts \nalways seemed to find their way back.  \n \nI was fed up and determined to find an answer. That answer for me \nwas a change in diet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long for me to see the \npositive results. My clearer skin so surprising that I was shocked \nnone of the skin care experts I had sought help from before ever \nmentioned it. I decided to set out on a mission to help others \nstruggling with imperfections looking for real answers to end their \nfight towards clear skin. And thus The Skin Nutritionist was born. \n \nThis recipe book has been a true labor of love for me.
