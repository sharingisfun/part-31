One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHeadlines for Jul 06, 2011\n\n- 35 Killed in Mounting Iraq Bombings\n- Report: U.S. Mulls Keeping 10,000 Troops in Iraq After Withdrawal Date\n- U.K. Admits Drone Piloted in U.S. Killed 4 Afghan Civilians; 4 NATO Troops Killed\n- British Army Medic Jailed for Refusing Afghan Deployment\n- U.S. Jailed Somali Prisoner Aboard Navy Ship for 2 Months\n- 14 Killed During Protests in Syrian Town\n- Gaza-Bound French Boat Defies Greek Ban\n- Captain of U.S. Gaza Flotilla Ship Released From Jail\n- Obama Summons Congressional Leaders for Debt Talks\n- Exxon Mobil: No Repair Plans in Place for Ruptured Montana Pipeline\n- In Reversal, Admin to Send Condolence Letters to Families of Vets Who Committed Suicide\n\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- Audacity of Hope: Inside Report Aboard U.S. Ship's Dramatic Challenge to Greek Ban on Gaza Flotilla\n\nA French boat carrying eight people as part of the 10-ship Freedom Flotilla to the Gaza Strip has left Greek waters, defying a ban imposed by Greece under heavy pressure from Israel and the United States. The small boat is the first to elude Greek authorities after two ships were stopped since Friday. Carrying humanitarian cargo, the ships are trying to reach Gaza just over a year after Israeli forces killed nine people aboard the first Freedom Flotilla. Democracy Now!'s Aaron MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was on board the U.S.-flagged ship, The Audacity of Hope, when it became the first flotilla ship to defy the ban and make a break for Gaza, only to be intercepted by Greek authorities in a dramatic standoff at sea. He filed this report.\n\n\n- A New McCarthyist Hysteria: WikiLeaks' Julian Assange Responds to Espionage, Terrorism Allegations\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in London July 2 for an unusual conversation with Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, moderated by Democracy Now!'s Amy Goodman. Assange is currently under house arrest in Norfolk, outside London, awaiting a July 12 appeals hearing on his pending extradition to Sweden for questioning on sexual misconduct allegations. He has not been charged with a crime in any country. In this excerpt from Saturday's discussion, Zizek and Assange respond to critics who say Assange should be charged in the United States under the Espionage Act of 1917 and that WikiLeaks should be shut down. &quot;We should always see censorship, actually, as a very positive sign, and attempts towards censorship as a sign that society is not yet completely sewn up, not yet completely fiscalized but still has some political dimension to it. I.E: What people think and believe and feel and the words that they listen to actually matters,&quot; says Assange.\n\n\n- WikiLeaks Readies Suit Against Credit Card Companies Over &quot;Economic Blockade&quot;\n\nDuring a July 2 discussion in London moderated by Democracy Now!'s Amy Goodman, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange discusses a new lawsuit WikiLeaks is filing against Visa and MasterCard for what he calls an &quot;economic blockade&quot; against his whistleblower group, preventing them from collecting credit card donations online. Mastercard, Visa and other financial giants cut off payment methods to WikiLeaks following the release of secret U.S. diplomatic cables last year. &quot;It is an extraordinary thing that we have seen, that Visa, MasterCard [and other companies] are instruments of U.S. foreign policy,&quot; Assange says.\n\n\n- WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange on Role of U.S. Cables in Helping Stir Arab Spring\n\nEarlier this year, WikiLeaks released a the largest trove of classified U.S. State Department cables in history, exposing the U.S. role in propping up unpopular regimes in the Middle East and supporting human rights abuses against opponents. During a July 2 discussion moderated by Democracy Now!'s Amy Goodman, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange highlighted the importance in releasing the information documented in the diplomatic cables, the impact WikiLeaks has had on world politics and journalism in general, and about the Arab Spring political uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, now continuing across the region in Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, and Libya.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c351df505da5a02b77956baa6ec45fa24ae94a","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+06+jul+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c351df505da5a02b77956baa6ec45fa24ae94a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,195,81,223,80,93,165,160,43,119,149,107,170,110,196,95,162,74,233,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
