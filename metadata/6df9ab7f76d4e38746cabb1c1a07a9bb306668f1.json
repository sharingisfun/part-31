This was his first venture recording using a Gibson Les Paul instead of his signature wood grain Fender Telecaster. I love this recording! It was released on CD in 2002. I own a mint vinyl copy that is signed. Unfortunately, this has been out of print for sometime. It did not do great in sales and went to the waste side. This is NO reflection on the quality of music offered. This was strictly a money issue. The only way to get this, that I know of, is if someone is willing to depart with their copy or some cheap mp3 release.\n\nPlease do not support mp3 sales of albums that should be released with complete sonic integrity!\n\nSeed this one...keep it going strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf you like this music...explore some of his other recordings. Nothing else in his catalogue sounds like this! Unfortunately, he is no longer with us physically.\n\nThis rip was from a Japanese Import release. \n\nThe song order is:\n\n1. The Opening...Miles From Earth 2:01\n2. Turn to Stone 5:48\n3. Fly...Night Bird 7:46\n4. 1841 Shuffle 4:17\n5. Down By The River 8:41\n6. Supernova 3:26\n7. You're Not Alone 8:01\n\nFrom Cumin aka Enja2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df9ab7f76d4e38746cabb1c1a07a9bb306668f1","amp;dn":"Roy+Buchanan%3A+You%5C%27re+Not+Alone+%5BRock%5D+%5BFlac%5D+%5Baka+Enja2011%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df9ab7f76d4e38746cabb1c1a07a9bb306668f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,249,171,127,118,212,227,135,70,202,187,28,26,7,169,187,48,102,104,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
