The programme of intent is based on a strong acknowledgement to the forces associated with the downtrodden. The name PombaGira comes from the Afro-Brazilian religion of Quimbanda. Within the confines of this religion for those socially marginalised, PombaGira's attributes are strength and protection. She is the wife/consort of Exu, a trickster spirit that has in the past been mistaken for the devil. She is the protectress of the downfallen, prostitutes and the weak. She commands obediance and is considered to have a fiery constitution. \nBecause she 'serves with both hands', an adage describing her flexible approach to how she treats humans, she is to be feared and revered. If you treat her with respect she will potentially grant you what you wish, however, if the compact is made and then broken she will unleash a surge of destruction that will leave no-thing standing. It is this kaleidoscope of hidden depth and potential within the expression of the life world, here enfleshed, that is made manifest through the medium of sound. It is this thin veneer between the hidden and the seen, the fixity of a reality and the possibility for exploration into the sphere of the invisible that defines the inspiration for the band. The Crooked Path is the course upon which we tread, to the faint-hearted it is a journey that one should not take. First LP is now out, it is available through this site and is also available through Shellshock distribution.\n\nEquipment we use those who may be interested: 2x 1973 Sunn Model T 150 watt/ Sunn Model T 1976 150 watt/ sunn 2000s 120 watt/1975 Orange 120 OR/Laney Klipp 100 watt 1975/ 1975 Selmer SV 100 watt treble and bass amp/1970s Simms-Watts 100 watt/ 1972 Impact by Status 120 watt/ 1973 Sound City 200 watt modified amp.
