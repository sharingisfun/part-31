Lily\n\nMutt is right. Cory Branan is no purebred. He boasts no pedigree, no papers. Instead, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a stray who wanders in off the street, of mixed breed: Is he another confessional singer/songwriter? An alt-country straggler? A frat-rock folk-hero? A Memphis misfit? A Southern voice descended more from Clyde Edgerton and Larry Brown than from Ronnie Van Zandt? Truth is, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit of everything, hanging around on the edges of various genres and taking what he needs from each. To date, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had a strange career: Rolling Stone thought enough of his witty 2002 debut, The Hell You Say, to devote a full-page spread to a beefcake shot of the Memphian, shirt unbuttoned just so. His follow-up took four years; his third album, six.\n\nBut heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth the wait. Few songwriters sum up the contradictions of beery romanceÃ¢â‚¬â€of bad men drinking in barrooms, of heartbreakers darkening your doorÃ¢â‚¬â€with quite as much grit, wit and compassion as Branan, who can turn a phrase on a dime. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Day-drinking and dreaming of you, I let the ashtray some my last cigarette,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sings on opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Corner,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which sums up his ethos perfectly. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Darken My DoorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bests anything Ryan Adams has written since Heartbreaker, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yesterday (Circa Summer 80 SomethinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a bittersweet teenage reverie that rewrites MellencampÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jack and DianeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into your new summer jam: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You were a walking want ad, you had summer on your side,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he leers. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You were dancing barefoot on the picnic table and dammit girl truly goddamit girl truly goddamit girl truly goddam!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBrananÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unruly cowlick of a voice may be the perfect vehicle for his lusty lyrics, capable of redeeming even some of his flatter sentiments (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking Ã¢â‚¬Å“she lines my coat with kitesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Ã¢â‚¬Å“KarenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work but somehow does). Being a musical mutt means taking risks, which Branan does with glee. Mutt is, appropriately, all over the damn place: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FreefallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a dusty southwestern vibe reminiscent of Calexico, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BadmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flair for drama, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SurvivorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the momentum of a drunk escapade in a stolen car.\n\nOccasionally, BrananÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s range can be a bit dizzying, resulting in some jarring transitions that trip up the middle third of Mutt. With its delicately plucked strings and crooner melodies, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lil HeartbreakerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ leads directly into the gypsy ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“Snowman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which sounds like a Tom Waits castoff. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re two of the weakest tracks here, and their pairing is all the more self-conscious and showy from an artist who otherwise sounds like he has absolutely nothing to prove. Mutt is a mess of an album, but I mean that in the best way possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:026bf0ea2ed57f7b26f4ed2470938297319b6b0b","amp;dn":"Cory+Branan+-+Mutt+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"026bf0ea2ed57f7b26f4ed2470938297319b6b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,107,240,234,46,213,127,123,38,244,237,36,112,147,130,151,49,155,107,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
