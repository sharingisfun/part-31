Edelstein, R.C. Cammarata (IOP Publishing, 1996).pdf\r\n\r\nThe study and application of nanomaterials, defined as materials of characteristic length less than a hundred nanometres continues to develop at ever-increasing speed.\r\nThis book provides an accessible introduction for the newcomer to the field - information previously only available in primary research papers and conference proceeding volumes. It comprises scholarly overviews of topics, principally dealing with physics, materials science and physical chemistry, written by leading, international researchers in academic, government and industrial institutions.\r\nIt includes practical information on how to make nanoparticles, examples of nanomaterials from fullerenes to biological examples, and surveys the electrical, optical, magnetic and transport properties of nanostructures., The book closes with a multifaceted look at future possibilities for commercial applications in such areas as electronics, memory devices, catalysis and quantum dots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ec534e3a459d9874209fdb48677b7b47f0e798","amp;dn":"Nanomaterials+-+Synthesis%2C+Properties+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77ec534e3a459d9874209fdb48677b7b47f0e798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,236,83,78,58,69,157,152,116,32,159,219,72,103,123,123,71,240,231,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
