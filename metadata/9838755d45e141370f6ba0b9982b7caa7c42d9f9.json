Just don't let different colors touch!\n\nEliss is an award winning and critically praised game, with innovative multitouch gameplay, a stylish and fluid procedural design, dynamic sounds, and a superb soundtrack. It's a fast-paced puzzle/action game that will push your limits as a player.\n\nEliss Infinity includes:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Infinity, a new game, this time endless and score based. Line up bigger combos to increase your score and receive larger powerups. This is the most fun and replayable Eliss has ever been.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Odyssey, the original game with its 25 levels, polished and this time with an interactive tutorial, and an unlockable music arpeggiator.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Spacebox, a new mode where you can generate planets and play with them without losing. Train your skills, release your stress, or let the younger children play.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A new slick look, and new features like warnings of future collisions, for a more pleasurable experience. And for the nostalgic, the option to revert to the original look.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ More music: two epic songs for Infinity, along with the four superb songs from Odyssey.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sync. Your progress can be saved on your Google account, so you can continue playing from any device, and multiple users can make their own progress on the same device. And it's solid: offline or on a spotty connection, you'll never lose any progress or scores submissions.\n\nAll of this wrapped within an original, brand new big pixel interface, beautifully designed from scratch. This game feels as splendid as your Android device.
