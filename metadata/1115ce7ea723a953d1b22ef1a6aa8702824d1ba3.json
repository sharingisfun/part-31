Killer Love was recorded between the United States and France and includes collaborations with Enrique Iglesias and Sting. Single Poison is a feisty, energetic slice of Electro-Pop, packed full of attitude, while Scherzingers excellent vocals prove she is just as good going solo as she is with the rest of the Dolls.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
