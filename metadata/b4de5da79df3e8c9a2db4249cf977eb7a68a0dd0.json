Brass bands are heavily dominated by the figure of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproprietorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ who manages and allocates his musicians according to his wishes and market demand. Unlike their classical-trained colleagues, these musicians, mostly of humble origins, are regarded with sheer indifference, and are paid accordingly by the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œproprietorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nThe New Bharat Brass Band of Bangalore is owned by Rama Swami, a former virtuoso of the clarinet. He conducts the Band while his brother arranges and harmonizes Bollywood hit songs for the wedding season. Most of the musicians are outsiders who used to play in smaller bands, although a few of them have hereditary associations with SwamiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orchestra. Half of them have other sources of income.\nThe selection is a mix of old and fresh themes. A Brass Band will usually play some 15 songs, with a few breaks, most probably repeating some tunes here and there, for a total of two hours. Brass Bands have been using synths, drums and loudspeakers for a few decades in order to overcome all other noise sources like car horns, constant firecrackers and varied sound systems.\nThe New Bharat Brass Band plays songs from films in several different Indian languages, and sometimes includes some Western tunes, like waltzes and South-American tunes. The Brass Band toured in Europe in 1992. Some say it was a huge success.\n\nClarinets: S. Ramesh, S. Kumar, S. Murti\nTrumpets: A. Antony, M. Channabasavanna, H. Hanumanthappa, V. Ramachandra, I.
