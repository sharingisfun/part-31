Ahmed, D. N. Meehan (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4987-5941-0\r\n\r\nAs the shale revolution continues in North America, unconventional resource markets are emerging on every continent. In the next eight to ten years, more than 100,000 wells and one- to two-million hydraulic fracturing stages could be executed, resulting in close to one trillion dollars in industry spending. This growth has prompted professionals experienced in conventional oil and gas exploitation and development to acquire practical knowledge of the unconventional realm.\r\n\r\nUnconventional Oil and Gas Resources: Exploitation and Development provides a comprehensive understanding of the latest advances in the exploitation and development of unconventional resources. With an emphasis on shale, this book:\r\n\r\nAddresses all aspects of the exploitation and development process, from data mining and accounting to drilling, completion, stimulation, production, and environmental issues\r\nOffers in-depth coverage of sub-surface measurements (geological, geophysical, petrophysical, geochemical, and geomechanical) and their interpretation\r\nDiscusses the use of microseismic, fiber optic, and tracer reservoir monitoring technologies and JewelSuiteTM reservoir modeling software\r\nPresents the viewpoints of internationally respected experts and researchers from leading exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies and academic institutions\r\nExplores future trends in reservoir technologies for unconventional resources development\r\nUnconventional Oil and Gas Resources: Exploitation and Development aids geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists, geomechanic specialists, and drilling, completion, stimulation, production, and reservoir engineers in the environmentally safe exploitation and development of unconventional resources like shale","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be21cff697ca2779c534d2f61af067e887a7e1f2","amp;dn":"Unconventional+Oil+and+Gas+Resources+Exploitation+and+Developmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be21cff697ca2779c534d2f61af067e887a7e1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,33,207,246,151,202,39,121,197,52,210,246,26,240,103,232,135,167,225,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
