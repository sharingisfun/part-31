The set contains many tracks, versions, and mixes not on any of the albums.\n\nAll cover scans are included.\n\nAs a bonus, also included here is the band's cover of Radiohead's 'Exit Music (For A Film)'.  It was contributed to a various artists' album of Radiohead covers (&quot;Anyone Can Play Radiohead&quot;), and was the last thing the band released.\n\n\n==  Note:\nThere is another torrent here (.flac files) which contains ostensibly the same material as this MP3 torrent.  But that torrent contains several mistakes and omissions, including:\n- no precise release dates given, only years (and one of those years is wrong);\n- spelling mistakes and incomplete track information;\n- no catalogue numbers;\n- and most importantly, that torrent contains an incorrect cover scan for the first single.  (It contains the US cover.  But the US issue had different tracks to the UK issue, so therefore that cover scan doesn't match the audio tracks.)\n\nThat torrent also does not include the Radiohead cover - which is included here as a bonus.\n\n\nSo this MP3 set here is the one to go for, in all ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41682e6e59292caf036956a554426a54e711d3c9","amp;dn":"Miranda+Sex+Garden+-+complete+singles+%28%2Brare+Radiohead+cover%29mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41682e6e59292caf036956a554426a54e711d3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,104,46,110,89,41,44,175,3,105,86,165,84,66,106,84,231,17,211,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
