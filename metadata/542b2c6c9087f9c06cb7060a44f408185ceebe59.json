Mauritz Stiller's masterwork exudes a startling primordial dramatic intensityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like visions conjured by acrid plumes of smoke. Nearly every scene is as striking as The Saga of Gosta Berling's famous sleigh-ride chase: the look in Concordia Selander's eyes as she divines her family's slaughter; the funeral-procession-on-ice for the maid who dies for the man she loved but promised to rip to shreds; and those trippy superimpositions that evoke the specter of guilt gnawing on the comfy faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of the present. Told in lucid, magical realist doses and suggesting a cross between Silas Marner and Earth, the story is a &quot;winter ballad&quot; about men who escape a prison, kill an aging vicar's family for his stolen treasure, and the love affair between one of the mercenaries and the only survivor of his carnage. Stiller's spine-tingling vision of moral crisis in the remote snowlands of Sweden has the quality of physiognomic cave artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½innately expressive and portentous and electrified by a remarkable score by Matti Bye and Fredrik Emilson that brings to mind a sinister Gregorian chant drifting through the nooks and crannies of an abandoned church. Always there's a sense that the story's characters are acting out an urgent and mythic act of social restoration. This ritual is feverish and hopeful and in no way diminished by the real-world tragedy that the death knoll was already chiming for this revolutionary period in early Swedish cinema.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/1770/vlcsnap1tp6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/1770/vlcsnap1tp6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/4562/vlcsnap23ep3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/4562/vlcsnap23ep3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img111.imageshack.us/img111/7862/vlcsnap12bx3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img111.imageshack.us/img111/7862/vlcsnap12bx3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/2781/vlcsnap17qb0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/2781/vlcsnap17qb0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip---------\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,525,504,000                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:47:25                \nFrame Count:....................................109561             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................17.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1695                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.325&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
