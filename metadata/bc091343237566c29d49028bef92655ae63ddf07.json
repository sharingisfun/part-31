Most big brand computers from HP, Dell and others use lower-quality components so they can meet their aggressive pricing targets. But component manufacturers also make high-quality parts that you can either purchase directly, or obtain through distributors and resellers. Consumers and corporations alike are opting to build rather than buy PCs to ensure high quality and compatibility.\nThe new edition of Building the Perfect PC shows you how to construct a variety of top-flight systems with the latest technology, including AMD Socket AM-2 and Intel Core 2 processors, that are Vista- and Linux-ready. The book includes several new options, including:\n\n* A Budget PC you can build for approximately $350 that offers performance and reliability similar to that of mainstream systems\n* A full-blown media-center system that runs Linux and MythTV or Windows MCE with multiple tuners and HDTV support\n* A fire-breathing high-performance gaming system\n* A fast, low-power, low-heat, low-noise, Small Form Factor system (the size of a shoe box)\n* A low-cost SOHO (small office, home office) server system with a 2 terabyte (2,000 GB) disk subsystem that's suitable for a residential environment rather than a server closet\n[img]http://1337x.org/torrentimg-9830.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc091343237566c29d49028bef92655ae63ddf07","amp;dn":"SHARE+GO+EBOOK-BUILDING+THE+PERFECT+PC.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc091343237566c29d49028bef92655ae63ddf07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,9,19,67,35,117,102,194,157,73,2,139,239,146,101,90,230,61,223,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
