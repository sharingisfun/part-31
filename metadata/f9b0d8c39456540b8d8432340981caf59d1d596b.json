Taylor is a pretty\n        seventeen-year-old student dealing with her parents' recent\n        divorce and painfully aware of her lower social status in high\n        school. When her mom gives her a computer for her birthday,\n        Taylor is excited by the prospect of going online to meet new\n        friends without her mother always looking over her shoulder.\n        However, Taylor soon finds herself the victim of betrayal and\n        bullying while visiting a popular social website. Obsessed with\n        the damaging posts, she begins to withdraw from her family and\n        friends, including her life-long best friend, Samantha Caldone\n        (Kay Panabaker). Tormented and afraid to face her peers at\n        school, Taylor is pushed to an extreme breaking point. It is\n        only after this life-changing event that Taylor learns that she\n        is not alone  meeting other teens, including a classmate, who\n        have had similar experiences. Taylor's mom, Kris (Kelly Rowan),\n        reels from the incident and takes on the school system and state\n        legislation to help prevent others from going through the same\n        harrowing ordeal as her daughter.\n        \n        Notes: crf 19, preset slower\n                            \n                                 \n                                                  \n      \n            \n                                                     \n                                                 \n                                                                      \n\n      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
