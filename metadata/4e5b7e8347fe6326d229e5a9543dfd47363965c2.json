Two assassins Soul and Shang, find a window of opportunity to strike\nwhile all their enemies can be found in one place. Their mission is simple:\ntake down all their enemies or die in the attempt. They will face many\nchallenges and discover lost secrets as they embark on a perilous journey\nagainst terrible odds.\n\nTake control of Soul and Shang and wield two separate martial arts styles to\ndefeat their foes.\n\nSoul is an orphan born with the temperament of a master. His skills are\nself-taught and so lack refinement, but his potential is undeniable. He favors\nDark Wound, a short bladed weapon given to him by his adoptive father, rumored\nto be one of the Night Masters..\n\nShang Zuo is a calm, unflappable fighter of average skill, but who possesses a\ncentered view of all things powerful enough to influence physical objects. This\n&quot;Sword Temper&quot; skill allows him to destroy objects without moving a muscle and\nto knock arrows out of the sky with but a single thought. Together they will\nface the unknown and harness new skills as they face down a terrible conspiracy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Installation notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
