The film, which recently won Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best DocumentaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the Atlantic City Film Festival, attempts to answer the question of how when humanity is so advanced, can ignorance and stupidity be so rampant?\n\nStupidity reveals:\n\nVery little is know about human stupidity\nSTUPIDITY may be the driving force of humankind.\nThe SHOCKING origins of the words moron, imbecile and idiot.\nStupidity is fueled by strong belief systems, left or right, and often smart people are the stupidest\n\nThe documentary also demonstrates the academic world has studiously avoided the topic of stupidity. Commissioned by the Documentary Channel and the CBC, Stupidity features interviews with Bill Maher, Selma Hayek, Noam Chomsky, and John Cleese. Directed by Trailervision founder Albert Nerenberg, the feature length documentary is poised for a full US release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96e04b69a9c6d768984d7e2eee66e968c23a871","amp;dn":"%5BDOCUMENTARY%5D+Stupidity+%28excellent%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96e04b69a9c6d768984d7e2eee66e968c23a871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,110,4,182,154,156,109,118,137,132,215,226,238,230,110,150,140,35,168,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
