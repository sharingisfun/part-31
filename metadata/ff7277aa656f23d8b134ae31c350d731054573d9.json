That the Aussies placed the satellite\ndish smack dab in the middle of an Australian\nsheep farm in the boondocks town of Parkes was\njust one of the reasons that NASA was concerned.\nBased on a true story, The Dish takes a smart,\nwitty, comical look at the differing cultural\nattitudes between Australia and the U.S. while\nrevisiting one of the greatest events in history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/4339/screensvo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/4339/screensvo.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSam Neill ...
