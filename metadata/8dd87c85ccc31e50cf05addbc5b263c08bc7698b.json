The central insights of this awareness is the recognition of the Emergent and Symbiotic elements of natural law and how aligning with these understandings as the bedrock of our personal and social institutions, life on earth can and will flourish into a system which will continuously grow in a positive way, where negative social consequences, such as social stratification, war, biases, elitism and criminal activity will be constantly reduced and, idealistically, eventually become nonexistent within the spectrum of human behavior itself. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContent:\n\n\nPart 1: Monetary Economics\n         Chapter 1: Mechanisms &amp; Consequences\n                  - The Need for Perpetual Turnover\n                  - The Abundance of Scarcity\n                  - The Priority of Profit\n                  - The Distortion of Values\n                  - Fiscal Manipulation\n         Chapter 2: The Final Failure\n                  - Beyond Irresponsibility\n                  - The Ultimate Outsource\nPart 2: What is Relevant?\n         Chapter 3: Natural Law\n                  - The Scientific Method\n                  - Dynamic Equilibrium\n         Chapter 4: The Means for Social Evolution\n                  - Goals\n                  - Method\n                  - Tools\n                  - Process\nPart 3: A Resource-Based Economy\n         Chapter 5: Social Cybernation\n                  - The Venus Project\n                  - Industry and Labor\n                  - Government\n         Chapter 6: Cities that think\n                  - Circular City\n                  - Transportation\n                  - Lifestyle\nPart 4: Overcoming Mythology\n         Chapter 7: Nature Vs.
