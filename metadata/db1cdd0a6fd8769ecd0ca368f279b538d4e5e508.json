If not, here is the article:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729197/g4-marks-the-end-of-aots-and-x-play-with-two-month-farewells/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729197/g4-marks-the-end-of-aots-and-x-play-with-two-month-farewells/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt sucks that these 2 awesome shows are ending. But at least we will have the memories or will we? I believe that all of the great footage from AOTS &amp; X-Play that is available at G4tv.com, on Youtube, &amp; wherever else will probably be taken away when the new network comes. So we will lose all of that great footage unless we do something. That is why I am hoping to archive AOTS, X-Play, &amp; G4 with this: The G4 Lives Project. What I am hoping to do is to keep G4's Legacy alive just like those who did the same with TechTV before me. \n\nSome Important Notes:\n\n\n1. The Goal is to post as many AOTS &amp; X-Play in packs. Either by segment, host, etc.\n\n\n2. The quality of the videos will vary. I am getting the best version for each vid (in HD when available).\n\n\n3. The sizes of the torrents for this project will vary as well. Some will be small &amp; others will be BIG!\n\n\n4. We are going to need help on this project. We can NOT do this all on are own(Only 2 people as of this writing). There are thousands &amp; thousands of videos to get from G4tv.com &amp; elsewhere for AOTS, X-Play, &amp; G4. So we are looking for volunteers to help us. If you are interested, let me know in the comments. So then we can coordinate about what you can do. Please guys I need help if this project is going to be successful. So please help out.\n\n\n\nThis is a Collection of various AOTS Segments it Includes :\n\nBody Count\n\nAsian UnderGround\n\nFresh Ink\n\nThreads\n\nGame Break\n\nMiscellaneous Videos\n\n\n\n 1st Torrent\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7841659/The_G4_Lives_Project_presents_AOTS__As_Seen_on_TV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7841659/The_G4_Lives_Project_presents_AOTS__As_Seen_on_TV&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1cdd0a6fd8769ecd0ca368f279b538d4e5e508","amp;dn":"The+G4+Lives+Project+presents%3A+AOTS+Segments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1cdd0a6fd8769ecd0ca368f279b538d4e5e508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,28,221,10,111,216,118,158,205,12,163,104,242,121,181,56,212,229,229,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
