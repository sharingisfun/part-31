And a kick-ass read to boot!!!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nScott Ian, guitarist for Anthrax&lt;!--end--&gt;\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Like philosophy itself, MetallicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music can scare the uninitiated, who fear their brains will hurt. This book makes both philosophy and Metallica accessible to the curious while deepening the experience of those already in the know.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nTheodore Gracyk, author of Rhythm and Noise and Listening to Popular Music\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Metallica and Philosophy is, at long last, the book which finally gives everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite headbangers due credit for being intelligent, questioning, and even cerebral.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nJoel McIver, author of Justice For All: The Truth About Metallica\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Not just heavy metal, not just rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, not just angst or anger or conceptual analysis, but a monster in a category of its own that shows us something dangerous about ourselves and our post-industrial culture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nDale Jacquette, Pennsylvania State University\n\n&quot;Intellectual snobs and proud low-brows alike may dismiss this as a joke- though obviously not respected academic publishers Blackwell ... as an introduction to some of the major schools of thought, it is no less worthy than popular books like Sophie's World that have also sought to bring philosophy to the mass market.&quot; \nTommy Udo, Metal Hammer\n\nA Ã¢â‚¬Å“provocative studyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on one of metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest bands, this paperback examines the connection between Metallica and highly regarded philosophers like Aristotle and Nietzsche, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“uses themes in MetallicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work to illuminate topics such as death, metaphysics, epistemology, the mind-body problem, morality, justice and what we owe one another.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Edited by a college professor, chapters include Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alcoholica: When Sweet Amber Becomes The Master Of Puppets,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Live and Die: Metallica and The Meaning Of LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boys Interrupted: The Drama Of Male Bonding In Some Kind Of Monster.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nMetal Edge Magazine\n\nBook Description\nHit the lights and jump in the fire, you're about to enter the School of Rock! Today's lecture will be a crash course in brain surgery. This hard and fast lesson is taught by instructors who graduated from the old school-they actually paid $5.98 for The $5.98 EP. But back before these philosophy professors cut their hair, they were lieutenants in the Metal Militia. Metallica is the &quot;thinking man's&quot; metal band and the headbanger's CNN. Snobs and music critics have often dismissed Metallica as mindless noise; we're here to set the record straight. &quot;In pursuit of truth no matter where it lies,&quot; this book considers questions that philosophers have been pondering for ages, including: Does Metallica's music provide an Aristotelian catharsis or does it just make kids go postal? Can &quot;Fade to Black&quot; save you from suicide? Are we all in the &quot;Sanitarium&quot;? How can we &quot;Escape&quot; to be free? What can Nietzsche tell us about the God That Failed? What can Descartes and &quot;One&quot; tell us about the relationship between the mind and the body? Did Lars make a sound argument against Napster? Metallica is more than just a band, and this book is much more than just a ticket to ride down memory lane. This is an in-depth analysis of the soundtrack to your life. So start your CD player, fire up your iPod, or, better yet, break out the old vinyl. We're going' for a ride with the four horsemen, and a few philosophers too.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 260 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (April 6, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1405163488\nISBN-13: 978-1405163484\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f5127ea348610085a146d812b1c83429380eef","amp;dn":"Metallica+and+Philosophy+-+Audio+and+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f5127ea348610085a146d812b1c83429380eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,245,18,126,163,72,97,0,133,161,70,216,18,177,200,52,41,56,14,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
