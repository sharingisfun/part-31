Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dre's feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts &quot;the karate kid&quot; on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8f76e457ef4dfb72b51eb965cbf007c285c719","amp;dn":"The.Karate.Kid%5B2010%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8f76e457ef4dfb72b51eb965cbf007c285c719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,143,118,228,87,239,77,251,114,181,30,185,101,203,240,7,194,133,199,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
