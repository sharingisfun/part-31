By situating Hume's popular argument in the context of the eighteenth-century debate on miracles, Earman shows Hume's argument to be largely unoriginal and chiefly without merit where it is original. Yet Earman constructively conceives how progress can be made on the issues that Hume's essay so provocatively posed about the ability of eyewitness testimony to establish the credibility of marvelous and miraculous events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7009863455fe30f3192acbf441559e76a3262e","amp;dn":"John+Earman+-+Hume%27s+Abject+Failure%3A+The+Argument+Against+Miracl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7009863455fe30f3192acbf441559e76a3262e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,112,9,134,52,85,254,48,243,25,42,203,244,65,85,158,118,163,38,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
