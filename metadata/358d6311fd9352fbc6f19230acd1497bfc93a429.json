He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop talking about the infamous Ã¢â‚¬Å“hot oysterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with local restaurateur James. He is reminded of his childhood through his forages for clams with local fishermen Patrick and John. A break-wall is as good as anywhere to cook up a fusion clam feast. Luke discovers some of the magic of the Loire Valley when he cooks a sumptuous rabbit dish in the cellar of an old chateau with owner Sebastian. They share a glass of wine, some freshly baked bread and a sing-a-long with some local fisherman, before Luke unearths the troglodyte fine dining scene.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 17-Jul-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:358d6311fd9352fbc6f19230acd1497bfc93a429","amp;dn":"Luke.Nguyens.France.S01E09.DVDRip.x264-W4F.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"358d6311fd9352fbc6f19230acd1497bfc93a429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,141,99,17,253,147,82,251,198,241,146,48,172,209,73,123,252,147,164,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
