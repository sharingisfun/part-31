Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage.\n\nThis involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.\n\nInstallation:\n1) Mount or burn game image;\n2) Install the game;\n3) Play the game without the CD.\n\nIf you like the game, buy the original.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f98119796c7e17725e74436ce50b563a7a8657","amp;dn":"Urban+Chaos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f98119796c7e17725e74436ce50b563a7a8657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,249,129,25,121,108,126,23,114,94,116,67,108,229,11,86,58,122,134,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
