The bonus tracks are from the bonus material that accompanied the original release. Tracks 12 through 15 were from the bonus CD, and 16 through 18 are from the bonus 12&quot;.\n\nOriginally based on the south coast of England in Portsmouth, Cranes released their first album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuse,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on cassette in 1990. This material was subsequently re-recorded and released as part of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSelf Non Self,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ released later that year.\nThe intensity of that album garnered very good reviews and caught the attention of John Peel, who picked up on the album right away, with the group recording a session for him in the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first week of release.\nShortly after drawing intense media attention, they signed to the label Dedicated (which also became home to Spiritualized and Beth Orton) and went on to record their EP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEsperoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in 1990, with the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWings of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ following a year later.\nThe release of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWings of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ caught the attention of Robert Smith of The Cure who picked the Cranes to open for them on their world tour in 1992, and then went on to record the albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œForeverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1993), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLovedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1994), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLa Tragedie dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Oreste et ElectreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1995), and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPopulation FourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1997).\nAfter a 4 year break, Cranes re-emerged on their own independent label Dadaphonic to release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFuture SongsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2001) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParticles &amp; WavesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2004), which saw the band heading in a more electronic direction while retaining the trademark sound of previous releases.\nIn January 2007 the band released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLive at Amsterdam Paradiso,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ originally recorded in 1991, just before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWings of JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album was released.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564b5dbfb9c0b7d7546453cb5e9ddeab32ca11bf","amp;dn":"Cranes...Wings+Of+Joy%281991%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564b5dbfb9c0b7d7546453cb5e9ddeab32ca11bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,75,93,191,185,192,183,215,84,100,83,203,94,157,222,171,50,202,17,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
