Like Hitman, AssassinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Creed is a game about a killer though very ancient one. A medieval setting for Kyd is not a barrier but vice versa itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an incentive. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just a stimulus to step into a territory of unusual for him creative directions, simply to do something new but to reinvent a particular music style, to deconstruct music, take all familiar elements to pieces so as to reconstruct them later to his own taste, gracefully ignoring standards and authenticity. For the composer who has long gone beyond the framework of electronic sound and pure genres, in whose career there was both cold IDM, organically woven into the disturbing orchestration, and choir of the Hungarian Radio, performing pseudo-Soviet patriotic songs in broken Russian to the accompaniment of techno rhythms and vintage synthesizers, there are no obstacles and nothing is impossible. Each new KydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work is not similar to the preceding, it has no analogues in the game industry and sometimes no analogues at all.\n\n** Technical data **\n\n[quote=Technical data]\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : C:\\Users\\BolZ\\Downloads\\Assassin's Creed II OST\\CD 1\\03 - Ezio's Family.mp3\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 9.07 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 57s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Assassin's Creed 2\nTrack name                       : Ezio's Family\nTrack name/Position              : 3\nPerformer                        : Jesper Kyd\nComposer                         : Jesper Kyd\nGenre                            : Soundtrack\nRecorded date                    : 2009\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98b\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nDuration                         : 3mn 57s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 9.07 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98b\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 20.5\n\n[/quote]\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/b84b/f907b06f.png[/img]\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaeea29270bbb14e2dbdb84b00a04368ed19d19c","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+II+OST%5BLossy+Mp3+320+Kbps%5D%5BTNTVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaeea29270bbb14e2dbdb84b00a04368ed19d19c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,238,162,146,112,187,177,78,45,189,184,75,0,160,67,104,237,25,209,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
