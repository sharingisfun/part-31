The tales of great high school soul-bands are still rare. A ballad or two on the random Douglass High School Stage Band album or Timeless LegendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mesmerizing entry on ColumbusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1972 1st Annual Inner City Talent Expo notwithstanding, high school bands rarely struck into the realm of Ã¢â‚¬Å“grown folksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ music. Enter The Equatics and their brooding masterpiece DoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ It!!!!\n\nIf this is categorized as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“funkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it was for the last ten years, by those few lucky enough to own an original copy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it holds its own. But it was as a soul band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one as inspired by the melancholic musings of Bill Withers as the psychedelic-pop of the self-proclaimed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Moses,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Issac Hayes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that the Equatics shone. These young souls offered world-weary, beat-heavy ballads that stand on par with any of the great independent organizations of the early 1970s. That a group of teenagers could offer such an angst-ridden plea as that of Leo DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Merry Go RoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ not only transcends the limitations that came from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s average age (seventeen, at the time of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording), but also the barriers the stood in front of this group of small-city hopefuls.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nowagainrecords.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nowagainrecords.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
