But even the most health-conscious among us want to treat ourselves once in a while to something sweet and indulgent. What if we could indulge without cheating on the diet? In this book, readers will find more than 100 recipes for amazing desserts that will leave you feeling satisfied, energized, and healthy.\n\nWhen Chef and caterer Anna Conrad was asked to provide paleo recipes for a fitness groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 28-day paleo challenge, she was a little skeptical. Could an athleteÃ¢â‚¬â€or even an average personÃ¢â‚¬â€really maintain a balanced body without any grains or dairy? Before agreeing to the job, she decided to follow the diet for two weeks to see how she felt. In that short amount of time, she lost eight pounds without feeling hungry or deprived, and her blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol all stayed within healthy limits. She gladly provided the recipes and now offers a paleo menu as a regular part of her catering business. In this book, she offers delicious dessert recipes, including:\n\n- Almond Butter Cookies\n- Bread Pudding\n- Chewy Chocolate Cookies\n- Chocolate Fudge Cake\n- Lemon Squares\n- Pecan Bars And More!\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/ktis3wrcv/anna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/ktis3wrcv/anna.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nAnna Conrad (1967-Present) was born in Los Angeles, CA.
