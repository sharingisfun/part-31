Edward Teller came to the United States from Hungary in 1935 and found a place for himself at the thorny intersection of science and politics: he was deeply involved in the decision to build a hydrogen bomb during the Second World War as well as the push for missile defenses during the 1980s. His most controversial act may have been his small role in the ordeal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who lost security clearance due to suspicious affiliations with Communist organizations. Teller says he disagreed with many of his colleague's views, but did not consider him a traitor. He also expresses remorse that his own congressional testimony was used against Oppenheimer: &quot;I proved not only that stupidity is a general human property but that I possessed a full share of it.&quot; The bulk of Memoirs concentrates on events during the 1940s and 1950s, though Teller's influence on President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative receives plenty of attention too.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bbfb247d1e59cac5eacaca452b4e803043be2a","amp;dn":"Edward+Teller+-+Memoirs+%5Bpdf+scan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bbfb247d1e59cac5eacaca452b4e803043be2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,187,251,36,125,30,89,202,197,234,202,202,69,43,78,128,48,67,190,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
