It's a good LP.  It's Fruscella's best recorded\n\nwork but that's not saying much because the poor guy self destructed before\n\ndoing much else.\n\n\nAfter I heard track #6 His Master's Voice...I bought the &quot;COMPLETE WORKS&quot;\n\n(see pic) thinking that I was in for a real treat.  SURPRISE!!    Apart from\n\nthis album the rest is mediocre at best IMO.  To make matters even worse\n\n(I hate wasting money) the sound quality of the &quot;COMPLETE WORKS&quot; is truly\n\nawful.  \n\n\nIt was so bad that by comparison my vinyl rip is HI-FI\n\n\n\nDon't buy the rest....this is as good as it gets Fruscella-wise\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101114f5a2c71909ee9ec3aba8e26436d3ce32af","amp;dn":"ATLANTIC+1220%2C++Tony+Fruscella%2C+1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101114f5a2c71909ee9ec3aba8e26436d3ce32af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,17,20,245,162,199,25,9,238,158,195,171,168,226,100,54,211,206,50,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
