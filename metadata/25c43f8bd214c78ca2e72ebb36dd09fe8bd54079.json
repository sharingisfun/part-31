Only, she must not tell Antrobus  1 X 45 mins\n\n2: A Husband Scorned - Liz falls for a client, whose wife has left him  1 X 45 mins\n\n3: Sharks Have Pearly Teeth - Liz gets involved in a case of industrial espionage and loan sharking. The answer though has impacts closer to home. 3 X 15 mins\n\n4: Fire - The Ace Agency has a new owner - Liz herself. She, Antrobus and Gloria must investigate a case of suspected arson.  3 x 15 mins\n\nAll four stories have a good storyline, while retaining a tongue gently in cheek. Great fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c43f8bd214c78ca2e72ebb36dd09fe8bd54079","amp;dn":"A+Confidential+Agent+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c43f8bd214c78ca2e72ebb36dd09fe8bd54079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,196,63,139,210,20,199,140,162,231,46,187,54,221,9,254,139,213,64,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
