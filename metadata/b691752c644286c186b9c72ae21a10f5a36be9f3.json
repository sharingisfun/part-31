This single year was a flashpoint for many of the social, political, and cultural transformations for which the overall decade of the 1960s is known. During these years, the United States became entrenched in an unpopular war in Vietnam abroad, while unrest, experimentation, violence, and outspokenness raged throughout the nation. The Civil Rights Movement gained momentum, sit-ins and riots became commonplace, leaders were assassinated on a seemingly regular basis, and social experimentation and psychedelic music became the rage in San Francisco and elsewhere. Many consider these years divisive, others shameful, yet some believe they were necessary to galvanize change in America.\n \nThe slowly building upheaval of the 1960s reached an apex in 1968. The tension that had been increasingly brewing over the previous years finally came to a head, exploding across 365 days of violence, uprising, and mourning. Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated, riots broke out at the Democratic National Convention, and the media coverage of the Tet Offensive exposed the gruesome underbelly of the Vietnam War. Together, these events signaled the powerful cultural, economic, and social changes that still reverberate today.\n\nThe History Channel documentary 1968 with Tom Brokaw is a two-hour special presentation featuring extensive video footage and mesmerizing new interviews. Brokaw, a young journalist in 1968, takes us through the yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important events, aided by testimonies from those closest to the action. Brokaw speaks to key leaders and participants in these events including Andrew Young-- the former Mayor of Atlanta who was standing next to Martin Luther King when he was assassinated, Rafer Johnson-- a close friend of Robert Kennedy who tackled the senatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassin in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, and musicians Bruce Springsteen, Arlo Guthrie, and James Taylor. Together, their insights help capture this dynamic and fascinating year in history, bringing viewers a fresh and incisive view of 1968, and what it all means today. Covering the political and personal, the cultural and scientific, 1968 with Tom Brokaw explores and deciphers this critical year in American History. Educators and their students will find this documentary to be a riveting retrospective of this era and its consequences for our lives today. \n\n**NOTE** - This is just a pointless, self-righteous insertion from the OP [me] - When a number, such as a year, is made plural [i.e. 1960s], there is no fucking apostrophe! The year is not possessive! Hence, this film is about the '60s, not the '60's. You'd think Tom Brokaw would know that. Grammar Nazi out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b691752c644286c186b9c72ae21a10f5a36be9f3","amp;dn":"1968+-+The+Year+That+Changed+Everything+%5BTom+Brokaw%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b691752c644286c186b9c72ae21a10f5a36be9f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,145,117,44,100,66,134,193,134,185,199,42,226,26,16,245,163,107,233,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
