Size really doesn't matter! ;) But this is NOT the 1920*1080 original. It's the 1280*1080!\r\n\r\nOriginal feed ts posted by Anonymous as: Eurovision Song Contest 2016: Stockholm (1st SF) [FEED 1080i]\r\n\r\nWORDS OF CAUTION WHEN PLAYING BACK!\r\n\r\nMedia player test/comparison -players used:\r\n- VLC 2.2.1\r\n- MS Media player Ver. 12.07601.19148\r\n- MPC+HC Media Player Classic with CCCP:MPC 64-bit 1.7.8.162/CCCP Raise Your Flag 2015-10-18\r\n\r\nPlaying back the original feed transport stream:\r\n- MS Media player: There's no image playing the original feed. There is sound, but no picture. File opens in a windows not corresponding with actual size.\r\n- VLC: Severe colour, time jump and image/sound sync issues. Colours are bled out with usually red remaining to some extent. Colour comes and goes. Does not correct sync.\r\n- MPC: Jump issues. Change slider and image is frozen for quite a while. No colour issues and possibly a 1/10 or 1/20 second image/sound sync issue at the end.\r\n\r\nPlaying back my 1080i re-encode:\r\n- MS Media player: Opens with lesser window size that image size. Severe jump issues with massive artifacts but clears in the end. No colour issues. Severe image/sound sync issues at the end.\r\n- VLC: Same colour issues as with the original. Image/sound sync issues, say, 1/10-1/8 of a second at the end.\r\n- MPC: Jump issues, as in image may adjust with some artifacts, to sync with unchanged sound. No colour issues. No discernible image/sound sync issues at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia player MPC comparison original with re-encoded file. No difference in image or sound that I can see or hear.\r\n\r\nRecommended media player is CCCP package with the Media Player Classic found at http://www.cccp-project.net/\r\n\r\nAudio AC3 pass-through and MP3 stereo dropped.\r\n\r\nVideo                          : Compressed\r\nID                             : 1\r\nFormat                         : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Video Codec\r\nBit rate                       : 5 646 Kbps\r\nWidth                          : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight                         : 1 080 pixels\r\nFrame rate mode                : Variable\r\n\r\nAudio                          : Pass-through\r\nID                             : 2\r\nFormat                         : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info                    : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension                 : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness    : Big\r\nCodec ID                       : ac-3\r\nDuration                       : 2h 5mn\r\nBit rate mode                  : Constant\r\nBit rate                       : 448 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                     : 6 channels\r\nChannel positions              : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\r\nBit depth                      : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode               : Lossy\r\nStream size                    : 402 MiB (7%)\r\nTitle                          : Surround / Surround","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c484eddc66edf9e41e820ff3198e73a244370be","amp;dn":"Eurovision.Song.Contest.2016.SF1.EBU-FEED.reenc.1080i.AC3-icecub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c484eddc66edf9e41e820ff3198e73a244370be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,72,78,221,198,110,223,158,65,232,32,255,49,152,231,58,36,67,112,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
