It is as if those \nstreetscapes themselves have gone some way to returning Godard to \nthe wellspring of his youthful inspiration. Eloge de l&amp;#039;Amour (which \ntranslates as In Praise of Love) is speckled with all the stylistic tics and \nnaive rhetorical mannerisms that have progressively alienated even his \nmost sympathetic audiences. But this, his latest film - a meditation on \nhistory, politics and love - unarguably has substance and a seriousness \nin its address to the viewer.\n\nThe director&amp;#039;s protagonist is Edgar, played by Bruno Putzulu, a \nhandsome boyish figure, evidently of considerable personal means \nfurnished for him by a wealthy artistic family. Edgar is brooding on the \nnesis of a project about love, but is unsure whether it should be a \nnovel, a play, a film or an opera. Edgar&amp;#039;s hesitancy certainly \ndemonstrates a wonderful disregard for the practicalities that harass \nevery other mortal artist in any of these media: a very Godardian note of \nsemi-intentional comedy. But any dilettante-ish tone is dispelled by his \nintense interest in one of the young women he has auditioned for this \nproject, who subsequently commits suicide.\n\nThe poignancy with which Godard invests this discovery is coloured by \nthe memory of Edgar having met her three years earlier, along with her \ngrandparents, resistance fighters who were with De Gaulle in London. \nEdgar, typically high-minded, wishes to consult with them for a cantata \nhe is writing about Simone Weil. But some boorish and arrogant US \nproducers are there too, attempting to railroad them in signing over \nrights for what is assumed to be a crassly illiterate Hollywood movie. It is \nin this second half, the platform for vintage anti-Americanism, that \nGodard switches from his luminous monochrome to a colour-saturated \nvideo, a mischievous ÃƒÂ©pat .\n\nThis film has the air of a celluloid commonplace book, a forum for \nGodard&amp;#039;s fragments and doodlings about love and history - fascinating \nin many ways, and pregnant with meaning, but often frustrating. Edgar&amp;#039;s \nreading in the classics has given him a taste for the epigram. &quot;Most \npeople have the courage to live their lives,&quot; he ponders, &quot;but not to \nimagine them.&quot; A brilliant aperÃƒÂ§u, but one we have to pay for with \nyards of maundering and meandering. Both Godard and Edgar are in \nsearch of the meaning of adulthood, that intensely realised period of self \nbetween the homogeneity of childhood and old age: it is a time in \nwhich the individual&amp;#039;s relationship with the constituent and determinant \nfactors of history are most fully realised.\n\nDirector and protagonist find their pivotal shift towards these political \ndeterminants in a happily chosen line from Georges Bataille: &quot;The \nantithesis of the loved one is the state whose sovereignty takes \nprecedence.&quot; This oppressive &quot;state&quot; finds, for Godard, its apotheosis in \nthe United States, which he excoriates as a place without history - a \nplace that tries to appropriate others&amp;#039; history: typical Yankee intellectual \nimperialism.\n\nThis is bolstered with some very unconvincing bluster about Sarajevo, \nKosovo and Vietnam. Since September 11, of course, the debate about \n&quot;anti-Americanism&quot; - a respectable dissenting viewpoint, or crypto-\nracism and schippiness? - has attained a new currency. But Godard&amp;#039;s \nblundering, dated naivety is not exonerated by any of this: he behaves \nas if France had no history of colonialism.\n\nFor all this, his observations about American cultural imperialism are not \nwithout wit. His characters find themselves, at one point, standing in front \nof a movie poster for Bresson&amp;#039;s Pickpocket, next to one for The Matrix. \nLater, Edgar reads aloud from Bresson&amp;#039;s Notes on the Cinematographer, \na passage about the primacy of stillness and silence, and some \nchildren come to the door, in historical dress, petitioning for state funds to \ndub The Matrix into Breton!\n\nIt is a very arch mode of drollery. Perhaps more striking is that great shift \nfrom celluloid monochrome to video colour. It could be a comment on \nthe nature of modernity, but the shift is for going back in time. Perhaps, \nGodard is humorously implying, black-and-white photography is the \nmost fiercely modern invention for representing reality: after all, no-one \nhad thought before that of painting in black and white. At all events, it is \na coup of a sort and In Praise of Love, like a cinematic poem, is a \ndifficult work, sometimes baffling and redundant, but often challenging \nand affecting.\n\nPhilip Bradshaw, THE GUARDIAN\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,603869,00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,603869,00.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy rip!\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Size (in bytes):                           734,240,768                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             42          \nPreload (in ms):                                504       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Aligned         \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  xvid  \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            01:38:30                \nFrame Count:                                    141710             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           688                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          384                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1,792                     \nFrames Per Second:                              23,87                 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           873                 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            112                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            VBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2           \n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
