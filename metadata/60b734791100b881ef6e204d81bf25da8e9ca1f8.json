Since being marooned on Earth for 400 years, Min Joon has diligently observed humans for centuries, ultimately coming to cynical conclusions, re-inventing himself every decade or so and staying under the radar. On top of being stunningly handsome, Min Joon has enhanced vision, hearing, agility and other powers Ã¢â‚¬â€ all the more reason to believe he's superior to everyone on Earth. That is, until he pursues the beautiful but spoiled, petulant and arrogant actress Cheon Song Yi for a romance that is out of this world and seemingly spans time. \n\n21 episodes. Approximately 59 minutes each.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b734791100b881ef6e204d81bf25da8e9ca1f8","amp;dn":"My+Love+From+Another+Star+Season+1+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b734791100b881ef6e204d81bf25da8e9ca1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,183,52,121,17,0,184,129,239,110,32,77,129,191,37,218,142,156,161,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
