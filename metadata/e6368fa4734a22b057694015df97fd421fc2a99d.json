However, it is also working for WALMART version of full game. Old saves working.\n\nIf you are using nosTEAM version:\n\n1. Install into main directory of the game.\n\n2. Enjoy game :)\n\n\nIf you are using WALMART version:\n\n1. Backup your whole game by copying it somewhere !!! (IMPORTANT)\n\n2. Install SOD_patch#2_nosTEAM.exe into main folder of the game.\n\n3. Copy steam_api.dll from WALMART mounted image crack folder into your SOD game folder, overwrite.\n\n4. Copy your saves from your backup SOD game Walmart-Local, there will be files like Class3.0.ulsave, to main directory of your game.\n\n5. Run game as administrator.\n\n6. Enjoy game :)\n\n\nIf there will be any problem, you can still use backup and play the game without patch. Tested it by myself on Walmart version two times. Hope it will work for you too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6368fa4734a22b057694015df97fd421fc2a99d","amp;dn":"State+of+Decay+Update+2+nosTeam%2C+Walmart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6368fa4734a22b057694015df97fd421fc2a99d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,54,143,164,115,74,34,176,87,105,64,21,223,151,253,66,31,194,169,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
