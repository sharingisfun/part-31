There have been albums of children's songs, the poems of Emily Dickinson, neo-psychedelia, Spanish folk songs of the Anda Jaleo, and a rock-ballet chantÃƒÂ©. I'm a Dreamer was recorded in Nashville with the truly gifted pianist Micah Hulscher and a host of players including husband Victor Herrero, Chris Scruggs, and Tommy Perkinson. Foster wrote all but one song, the closer, a gorgeous cover of Vernon Duke's standard &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (revisioned as a parlor song). She also uses a Rudyard Kipling poem for the lyrics to &quot;Blue Roses.&quot; Opener &quot;Sugarpie I'm Not the Same&quot; is swinging country blues that floats to the present via the barroom stages of the postwar years. It's a delightful shuffle with Hulscher's honky tonk flourishes and a Foster harmonica solo. The brushed drums and acoustic guitars frame her distinctive voice and bittersweet lyric. Scruggs' weepy steel guitar colors the forlorn &quot;No One's Calling Your Name,&quot; as Hulscher punctuates Foster's sweet yet mournful lines. The simmering desire in &quot;My Wandering Heart&quot; is underscored by Dave Roe's double bass that leads the gently swinging ensemble; in her delivery, Foster unhurriedly allows the words to drip from her mouth subtly, yet provocatively, like honey. &quot;Pretty Please&quot; weds postwar American country to the lyric and melodic savvy of Stephen Foster. The spare, bleed-through mix of &quot;Magenta&quot; finds cello, brushed snare, piano, and a restrained, reverbed electric guitar barely illustrating Foster's mezzo-soprano. The effect is warm, tender, seductive, brimming with eros disguised as sentiment. &quot;This Is Where the Dreams Head, Maude&quot; finds its root in early-'30s speakeasies. Its gently swaying 4/4 weds jazz, early country, and blues in a gauzy nocturnal whole. Though I'm a Dreamer harks back to Foster's down-home roots, she is much more sophisticated as a writer and arranger. She is in full command of her vision, which articulates a unique musical language here, formulated in familiar tropes. Given how mercurial she's been, this stylistic return may be temporary, but it's so fully realized, it's also a most welcome one...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b106afef7e61040462fbad8bcd8401c77938e39","amp;dn":"Josephine+Foster+-+I%27m+A+Dreamer+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC.CUE%2CLOG.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b106afef7e61040462fbad8bcd8401c77938e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,16,106,254,247,230,16,64,70,47,186,216,188,216,64,28,119,147,142,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
