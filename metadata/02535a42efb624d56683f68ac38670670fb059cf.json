In defending the immaterialism for which he is most famous, he redirected modern thinking about the nature of objectivity and the mind's capacity to come to terms with it. Along the way, he made striking and influential proposals concerning the psychology of the senses, the workings of language, the aims of science, and the scope of mathematics. In this Companion volume a team of distinguished authors not only examines Berkeley's achievements but also his neglected contributions to moral and political philosophy, his writings on economics and development, and his defense of religious commitment and religious life. The volume places Berkeley's achievements in the context of the many social and intellectual traditions - philosophical, scientific, ethical, and religious - to which he fashioned a distinctive response.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02535a42efb624d56683f68ac38670670fb059cf","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Berkeley+%5BENG%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02535a42efb624d56683f68ac38670670fb059cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,83,90,66,239,182,36,213,102,131,246,138,195,134,112,103,15,176,89,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
