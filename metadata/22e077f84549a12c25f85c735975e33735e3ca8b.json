Limited pressing 2008.\n\nDeep Purple survived a seemingly endless series of lineup changes and a dramatic mid-career shift from grandiose progressive rock to ear-shattering heavy metal to emerge as a true institution of the British hard rock community; once credited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the globe's loudest band, their revolving-door roster launched the careers of performers including Ritchie Blackmore, David Coverdale (the White Snake guy, lol), and Ian Gillan.\n\nShades of Deep Purple (1968)\nThe Book of Taliesyn (1968)\nDeep Purple (1969)\nDeep Purple in Rock (1970)\nFireball (1971)\nMachine Head (1972)\nWho Do We Think We Are (1973)\nBurn (1974)\n\n(Stormbringer was left off, I apologize, I thought I had it. but no.)\n\nThis isn't meant to be a complete discography, but a good overview of their early albums, and in my opinion, by far their best work before all the line up changes. This is essential music.\n\nThanks to Igor191965 and Shar'EmAll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e077f84549a12c25f85c735975e33735e3ca8b","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+8+Albums+Japanese+SHM-CD+MP3+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e077f84549a12c25f85c735975e33735e3ca8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,224,119,248,69,73,161,44,37,248,92,115,89,117,227,55,53,227,202,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
