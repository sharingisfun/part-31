This was recorded from TV in the 1990s.\n\nAnd apologies for the quality.  It is watchable but is a conversion from a VHS video.  As Ghost Dances doesn't seem to be available anywhere else, I thought it was worth uploading it.\n\nThis is a .avi file.  I am not technical so don't ask for any specific details on codecs etc!\n\n\nHopefully more people will seed this as I don't have internet at home and can only seed when I'm online.  Be patient!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2de6a71f1ec54631ac09fd23b9bdc8393fa582","amp;dn":"Ghost+Dances","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e2de6a71f1ec54631ac09fd23b9bdc8393fa582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,45,230,167,31,30,197,70,49,172,9,253,35,185,189,200,57,63,165,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
