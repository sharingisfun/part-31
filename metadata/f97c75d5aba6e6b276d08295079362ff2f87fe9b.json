Others were more difficult to reduce (the fragmented &quot;Strange Hostel...&quot;, for example, has many characters and situations).\n\nI believe that this &quot;new movie&quot; is really fun - especially for those who have seen the three &quot;cut&quot; films, and can better evaluate if they work well as short episodes or not. I hope you all have as much fun as I had re-working these films into short episodes! Maybe they had been better received if released in this short format in the 70s, and not as boring and redundant feature films!\n\n\n\n***** WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES? *****\n\nFirst of all, I cut the chaotic Coffin Joe speech in the beginning of &quot;Strange Hostel...&quot; from 15 to 4 minutes, making sort of a &quot;official presentation&quot; to my anthology by Coffin Joe himself! \n\nSo I reused the opening credits of &quot;Strange Hostel...&quot;, but putting the name &quot;The Strange World of Coffin Joe Part 2&quot; in the same place of the original, and my credit as &quot;re-edited by&quot;. I cut the names of the actors of &quot;Strange Hostel...&quot;, but kept the names of Nilcemar Leyart, Rubens Francisco Lucchetti and Giorgio Attili, since they all worked in the three films that I used to make this fan edition.\n\nEach movie has been turned into episodes, and the original Portuguese name appears at the beginning (I cut the opening credits of &quot;Hellish Flesh&quot; and &quot;Perversion&quot;).\n\nNow, a summary of cuts in each &quot;episode&quot;:\n\n\n\nHELLISH FLESH (1977)\n\nPLOT:\nMarins plays a scientist who spends too much time in his lab. His wife conducts an affair with a mutual friend. The pair then concoct a plan to kill the hapless husband. The wife pours acid on his face and her lover sets fire to his lab. But the scientist survives albeit with a creepy burned face, while the wife suffers a bad life as her lover is a good-for-nothing gambler and womaniser. But things only get even more complicated. \n\nTHE DIFFERENCES:\nThe original runtime of 85 minutes (too looooooong) was shortened to 27 minutes. \n* I cut the opening credits and shortened all the scenes with Mojica in his lab (yeah, you are a scientist, I get it, I don't need 15 minutes of takes with colored liquids and test tubes!) \n* I shortened the scene in which Raquel and her lover plan to murder the scientist. \n* I cut the awful and boooooooring takes of a real eye surgery. \n* I shortened the scenes in which Raquel's lover have sex with other women (don't worry, I kept most of the nudity, I just cut what was repeated). \n* I cut the scene where Rachel is hit by a car and her treatment in the hospital, which did not add absolutely nothing to the plot.\n* I cut all the scenes of Helena Ramos with a mysterious man, who originally interrupted the narrative. Now, the existence of her character is part of the surprise ending (and I think it was much better this way).\n* Finally, I cut a lot of scenes with people walking through gardens, interiors of houses, along streets, etc. etc..\n\n\n\nPERVERSION (1979)\n\nPLOT:\nA prominent millionaire gets a woman drunk and rapes her, biting off her nipple in the process. Because of his influence and powerful lawyer, though, he is able to beat the rap, claiming the woman was trying to extort money from him. He continues his life of debauchery, flaunting his power, until he meets a new woman. Falling madly in love with her, he cleans up his act and devotes his attentions to her, not realizing that she has a hidden agenda.\n\n\nTHE DIFFERENCES:\nI consider this movie just unbearable, so I cut the original runtime of 86 minutes (Holy Crap!) to mere 24 minutes. \n* I cut the opening credits and used a few takes of a party that originally occurred in half of the movie to start the episode, only then going to the scene of the rape of the girl (the way the film originally started).\n* From the trial I left a single party with the millionaire and his friends, and cut three or four others, including a scene in which the millionaire and his friends go to a lame play.\n* I cut the scene in which the millionaire shows the nipple of the raped girl as a trophy for his friends, since the nipple is also shown in another scene after that I kept (thus, the revelation does not lose impact).\n* I cut the scene where the millionaire seduces a second girl and threatens to tear her eyes with his nails - but that doesn't happen, making the whole scene expendable.\n* I shortened nearly 20 boooooooring minutes of cheap romance, in the beach, in the yacht, in the gardens, etc., for a simple &quot;montage&quot; of 50 seconds!\n\n\n\nTHE STRANGE HOSTEL OF NAKED PLEASURES (1976)\n\nPLOT:\nIn a stormy night, a misterious hostel gets filled with dozens of guest, including partying hippies and gambling gangsters who soon begin to suspect that the place is far from normal when they each look at their watches and discover that time is standing still.\n\n\nTHE DIFFERENCES:\nThe original runtime of 81 minutes was shortened to 37 minutes. It's the longest episode because of the amount of characters and events, although the story is quite simple.\n* I reused the Coffin Joe speech and the opening credits of the film in the opening of this anthology, and cut a second introduction (???) with another Coffin Joe speech between images of the cosmos.\n* I rearranged the order of arrival of the guests at the hostel, and cut one of the characters: a girl who lost her memory.\n* I cut a opening scene in which new employees are hired by the hostel, simply because it makes no sense in the logic of the plot.\n* I shortened almost all the scenes inside the rooms, especially those with the poker players and the orgy of the hippies (because of excessive repetition of takes).\n* I put the scene where some of the guests discover that their watches have stopped, originally shown at the end of the film, in half the episode to increase the atmosphere of mystery.\n* I cut all the scenes in which the character of Mojica is wandering around the hostel and looking to animals like rats and spiders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97c75d5aba6e6b276d08295079362ff2f87fe9b","amp;dn":"The+Strange+World+of+Coffin+Joe+Part+2+%28fan-edit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97c75d5aba6e6b276d08295079362ff2f87fe9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,124,117,213,171,166,230,178,118,208,130,149,7,147,98,255,47,135,254,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
