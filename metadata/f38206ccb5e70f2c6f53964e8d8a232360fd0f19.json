As such, some of them aren't of the best quality and they generally look different from one another. Some look good, some are just passable. Issues 9 and 10 were so small that you couldn't read a lot of the word bubbles, so I did run those images through the photo editor and enlarge them a bit.\n\nLastly, neither of these series are complete. The first series is missing 11-12, the second 4-6. I'd rather not upload incomplete runs, but it's a request and this is what I have.\n\nIssues 1-10 of Gargoyles\nIssues 1-3 of Gargoyles: Bad Guys\n\nYou can read much more about this series here...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyles_%28comic%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyles_%28comic%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f38206ccb5e70f2c6f53964e8d8a232360fd0f19","amp;dn":"Gargoyles+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f38206ccb5e70f2c6f53964e8d8a232360fd0f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,130,6,204,181,231,15,44,111,83,150,78,141,138,35,35,96,253,15,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
