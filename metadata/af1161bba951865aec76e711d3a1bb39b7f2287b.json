This release 1997 on Columbia Legacy.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis CD reissues one of Carmen McRae's best recordings of the 1960s. McRae always considered Billie Holiday to be her primary influence, so a tribute album was a natural project for her. Joined by her regular trio (pianist Norman Simmons, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Walter Perkins) and three guests (cornetist Nat Adderley, tenor man Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, and guitarist Mundell Lowe), the singer interprets a dozen songs associated with Lady Day. Although Holiday's influence can be felt, McRae already had her own distinctive voice and phrasing, resulting in fresh versions of such songs as &quot;Them There Eyes,&quot; &quot;Miss Brown to You,&quot; &quot;I Cried for You,&quot; and even &quot;God Bless the Child.&quot; A coolly emotional version of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (in which she is accompanied just by Lowe's guitar) is a highlight. In addition, two songs not originally included on the LP (&quot;If the Moon Turns Green&quot; and the slightly out of place but still satisfying &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;) were added to the reissue. Recommended.\n\n01. Them There Eyes   \n02. Yesterdays   \n03. I'm Gonna Lock My Heart  \n04. Strange Fruit   \n05. Miss Brown To You    \n06. My Man  \n07. I Cried For You  \n08. Lover Man    \n09.
