As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the vocalist's role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations, as many of his songs became popular standards and his best albums became undisputed classics of the rock &amp; roll canon. Dylan's influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the '80s and '90s, Dylan's presence rarely lagged, and his commercial revival in the 2000s proved his staying power. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95% CDDA &amp; 97.47% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalog:\t\t9781908709301\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Blowin' In The Wind\n02.Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\n03.The Times They Are A-Changin'\n04.It Ain't Me, Babe\n05.Maggie's Farm\n06.It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\n07.Mr Tambourine Man\n08.Subterranean Homesick Blues\n09.Like A Rolling Stone\n10.Positively  4th Street\n11.I Want You\n12.Just Like A Woman\n13.Rainy Day Women #12 And 35\n14.All Along The Watchtower\n15.Lay, Lady, Lay\n16.If Not For You\n17.You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\n18.I Shall Be Released\n19.Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n20.Tangled Up In Blue\n21.Forever Young\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Shelter From The Storm\n02.Hurricane\n03.Gotta Serve Somebody\n04.Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\n05.Jokerman\n06.Everything Is Broken\n07.Blind Willie McTell\n08.Not Dark Yet\n09.Make You Feel My Love\n10.Dignity\n11.Things Have Changed\n12.Mississippi\n13.Thunder On The Mountain\n14.When The Deal Goes Down\n15.Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd34620132d6a51d9eba39ef690c589adca26c8","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Music+and+Photos+%282013%29+Flac+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd34620132d6a51d9eba39ef690c589adca26c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,211,70,32,19,45,106,81,217,235,163,158,246,144,197,137,173,202,38,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
