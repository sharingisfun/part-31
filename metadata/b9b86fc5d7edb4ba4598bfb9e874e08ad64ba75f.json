In a close result, one team wins a glamorous photo shoot, while the other is forced to serve the winners lunch and prep both kitchens for the evening's service. In a packed dinner service, anxiety is higher than usual when celebrities Eric McCormack and Robert Patrick stop by. The meat station is the downfall for one chef, who is sent home during service. The elimination of this chef seems to have a positive effect on their team, leading them to rally and complete a full service. The losing team struggles to even decide whom they want to nominate to go home.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nOf Interest: \n\n- 2 chefs are sent home during this episode, which is somewhat unusual for the series that typically sends only 1 contestant home per episode. \n\n---------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b86fc5d7edb4ba4598bfb9e874e08ad64ba75f","amp;dn":"hells.kitchen.s05e08.hdtv-xvid.pwe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b86fc5d7edb4ba4598bfb9e874e08ad64ba75f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,184,111,197,215,237,180,186,69,152,191,185,232,116,224,138,214,75,167,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
