The host and star of the show was Vincent Price.\n\nThis show stands out in Price's radio career as some of the episodes were based on fictional adventures of Vincent Price himself, playing himself, while others had him merely introducing the macabre tale of the week. Twenty-two episodes were produced; writers on the series included William Ingram, Stanley Ellin, Richard Davies, R. Chetwynd-Hayes, A.M. Burrage, Elizabeth Morgan, Rene Basilico, Roald Dahl and Price himself.[1] Fifteen of the episodes were rebroadcast by BBC Radio 7 in the spring of 2010.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thesoundofvincentprice.com/fear.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thesoundofvincentprice.com/fear.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thesoundofvincentprice.com/fear.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thesoundofvincentprice.com/fear.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[b]Some cleaning has been done on the 64k\nEndings and starts added to the missing ones.\nSaved as 64k 2 channel for MP3 players\n[/b]\n\nThe Price Of Fear - 01 - William And Mary [b]&lt;&lt; Poor quality[/b]\nThe Price Of Fear - 02 - Come As You Are \nThe Price Of Fear - 03 - Speciality Of The House \nThe Price Of Fear - 04 - The Man Who Hated Scenes \nThe Price Of Fear - 05 - Soul Music \nThe Price Of Fear - 06 - The Ninth Removal \nThe Price Of Fear - 07 - Soul Music \nThe Price Of Fear - 08 - An Eye For An Eye \nThe Price Of Fear - 09 - The Waxwork \nThe Price Of Fear - 10 - Lot 132 \nThe Price Of Fear - 11 - Fish \nThe Price Of Fear - 12 - Blind Man's Bluff \nThe Price Of Fear - 13 - Cat's Cradle \nThe Price Of Fear - 14 - Meeting In Athens \nThe Price Of Fear - 15 - Remains To Be Seen \nThe Price Of Fear - 16 - The Family Album \nThe Price Of Fear - 17 - Not Wanted On The Voyage \nThe Price Of Fear - 18 - Goody Two Shoes \nThe Price Of Fear - 19 - To My Dear, Dear Saladin \nThe Price Of Fear - 20 - Out Of The Mouths \nThe Price Of Fear - 21 - Is There Anybody There \nThe Price Of Fear - 22 - Never Gamble With A Loser [b]&lt;&lt; Missing[/b]\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 &amp; 64Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d245366c87c5c3a0248159db926367b04e6ef20d","amp;dn":"The+%5BVincent%5D+Price+Of+Fear+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d245366c87c5c3a0248159db926367b04e6ef20d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,69,54,108,135,197,195,160,36,129,89,219,146,99,103,176,78,110,242,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
