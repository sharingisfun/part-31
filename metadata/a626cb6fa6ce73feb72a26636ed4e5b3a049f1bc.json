The first thing I noticed about this release is the sinister air of iniquity and vile sense of ugliness that it conveys. Now, whether it was intentional or not, the artworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s color scheme (or lack there of) hints that there is something very different about it compared to the many modern death metal albums currently saturating the scene. Put it in a row with any five brutal death metal CDs that you have which were released in the same number of recent years and Degrade The Worthless, the debut album from Pus Vomit (Philippines) sticks out just like a dead finger nail.\n\nSpeaking of dead, there are no less than four tracks here with a title containing that particular word. In fact, all song titles look as if they were pulled out of some serial killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal journal containing writings about the gruesome acts he plans to do or had already done to his victims. Herein lies words that are perverse, straight to the point, and strangely enough, all too personal. It all seems so real.                                          1. \tShe Died a Virgin \t03:06 \t \n2. \tSoaked in Her Own Blood \t02:46 \t \n3. \tGod Help Me Rape the Dead \t02:15 \t \n4. \tPungent Rotting Flesh \t02:28 \t \n5. \tSelf Inflicted Wound \t03:17 \t \n6. \tDead for Rent \t02:58 \t \n7. \tYour Dead Body I Molest \t03:22 \t \n8. \tDead Remains \t02:24 \t \n9. \tRetching Lacerated Entrails \t03:11 \t \n10. \tDismembered Virgin Limbs \t04:13 \t \n  \t30:00 \t                                                     Ryan \tDrums\nLouie \tGuitars\nMarco \tVocals                                                    ................Seed if ya can these torrents dont live for long I wish it were different..........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a626cb6fa6ce73feb72a26636ed4e5b3a049f1bc","amp;dn":"Pus+Vomit+-+Degrade+The+Worthless++mp3+++Metal++++2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a626cb6fa6ce73feb72a26636ed4e5b3a049f1bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,38,203,111,166,206,115,254,183,42,38,99,110,212,229,179,160,73,241,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
