Schilling (McGraw-Hill, Irwin, 2013).pdf\n\nISBN 9780078029233\n\nStrategic Management of Technological Innovation, 4e by Melissa Schilling is the first comprehensive and rigorous, yet accessible text for the Technology and Innovation Management course. Unlike other books, SchillingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach synthesizes the major research in the field, providing students with the knowledge needed to enhance case discussion and analysis. The subject is approached as a strategic process, and as such, is organized to mirror the strategic management process used in most strategy textbooks, progressing from assessing the competitive dynamics of a situation, to strategy formulation, to strategy implementation. As a brief, affordable paperback, it is ideal to package with cases. Recommended case sets from the author are available through McGraw-Hill Create or from the Harvard Business School Case Database","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e349d90c483074845ab30a6741dc0b9a1c0ef204","amp;dn":"Strategic+Management+of+Technological+Innovation+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e349d90c483074845ab30a6741dc0b9a1c0ef204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,73,217,12,72,48,116,132,90,179,10,103,65,220,11,154,28,14,242,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
