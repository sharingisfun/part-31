Long, unpredictable work hours. Extended absences. The dangers inherent in their jobs. Yet after being with Evan once, it was inconceivable she wouldn't be with her again. \n\n When they finally have a chance to get things right, danger follows them home from Afghanistan. Now, Tate and Evan must stand together in a show of force or risk losing everything - including their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a6eaff2b379065f88d52d2f0b7c0c868ed3627","amp;dn":"Shoe+of+force+-+AJ+Quinn+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a6eaff2b379065f88d52d2f0b7c0c868ed3627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,166,234,255,43,55,144,101,248,141,82,210,240,183,192,200,104,237,54,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
