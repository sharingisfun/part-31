Despite Sweeney Todd being from the UK, the band is primarily based out of Boston, Massachusetts. The duo personally financed the release of 2 EPs before signing to Taang! Records. Their eponymous debut LP was released on April 8th, 2008. Various friends and musicians contributed to the record but the band's most current lineup is Barton and Todd, along with Mike McMillen (lead guitar), Sean Laforce (bass), and Kevin Garvin (drums), all previously from the Boston area Metalcore band On Broken Wings. Recently, Sweeney Todd has left the band. While rumors fly as to who his replacement will be, no one has been announced at this time.\n\nUpped by LogicTurtle.
