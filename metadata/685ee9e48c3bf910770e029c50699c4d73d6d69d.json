Bad examines the long line of thieves, rapists, varmints, codgers, dodgers, manipulators, exploiters, conmen, killers, vamps, liars, demons, cold-blooded megalomaniacs, and warmhearted flakes that populate cinematic narrative. From Nosferatu to The Talented Mr. Ripley, the contributors consider a wide range of genres and use a variety of critical approaches to examine evil, villainy, and immorality in twentieth-century film.\n\nAbout the Author\nMurray Pomerance is Professor and Chair in the Department of Sociology at Ryerson University. He is the editor of Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls: Gender in Film at the End of the Twentieth Century, also published by SUNY Press, and Enfant Terrible!: Jerry Lewis in American Film.\n\nPublisher: State University of New York Press (4 December 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 079145939X\nISBN-13: 978-0791459393","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685ee9e48c3bf910770e029c50699c4d73d6d69d","amp;dn":"Bad+Infamy%2C+Darkness%2C+Evil%2C+and+Slime+on+Screen%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685ee9e48c3bf910770e029c50699c4d73d6d69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,94,233,228,140,59,249,16,119,14,2,156,80,105,156,77,115,214,214,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
