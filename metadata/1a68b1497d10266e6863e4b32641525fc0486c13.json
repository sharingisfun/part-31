The series first appeared in French in a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le VingtiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me SiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨cle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, the series has continued as a favourite of readers and critics alike for 80 years.\n\nThe hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colourful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.\n\nThe success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date.\n\nThe comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s signature ligne claire style.Engaging,Well-researchedplots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humour, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.\n\n\n*****************************\nCONTENTS\n*****************************\n00 THE REVIEW\n\n01 TINTIN IN THE LAND OF SOVIETS\n\n02 TINTIN IN THE CONGO\n\n03 TINTIN IN AMERICA\n\n04 CIGARS OF THE PHAROH\n\n05 THE BLUE LOTOUS\n\n06 THE BROKEN EAR\n\n07 THE BLACK ISLAND\n\n08 KING OTTOKAR'S SCEPTRE\n\n09 THE CRAB WITH THE GOLDEN CLAWS\n\n10 THE SHOOTING STAR\n\n11 THE SECRET OF THE UNICORN\n\n12 THE RED RACKHAM'S TREASURE\n\n13 THE SEVEN CRYSTAL BALLS\n\n14 THE PRISONERS OF THE SUN\n\n15 THE LAND OF BLACK GOLD\n\n16 THE DISTINATION MOON\n\n17 THE EXPLORERS ON THE MOON\n\n18 THE CLCULUS AFFAIRS\n\n19 THE RED SEA SHARKS\n\n20 TINTIN IN TIBET\n\n21 THE CASTAFIORE EMERALD\n\n22 THE FLIGHT 714\n\n23 TINTIN AND THE PICAROS\n\n24 TINTIN AND THE ALF-ART\n\n25 TINTIN AND THE LAKE OF SHARKS\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a68b1497d10266e6863e4b32641525fc0486c13","amp;dn":"Tintin+-+Herge+++%28The+Complete+Collector%5C%27s+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a68b1497d10266e6863e4b32641525fc0486c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,104,177,73,125,16,38,110,104,99,228,179,38,65,82,95,192,72,108,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
