Lay Me Down\n\nMuch like the album before it, Everyday Balloons sketches a coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise in warm, soft-spoken strokes. Vocalists Sarah Winchester and Aaron Gerber sing their songs like sedate stage performers, often trading off lines or addressing each other directly. There are others in the band, of course, and their splashes of piano and acoustic guitar help create the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmospheric backdrop. When instrumentation is as simple as this, though, the focus is all about the foreground, leaving the co-ed vocals and lyrics to keep the ship afloat. A Weather may seem deadset on depressing its listeners, yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a certain degree of ingenuity in the way the band sustains its melancholy over the course of 51 minutes, and GerberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics continue to find new ways of expressing heartbreak. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You smell like old clothes I used to know but havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worn in awhile,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sings during the second track. Elsewhere, he remembers his departed lover after stumbling across her bobby pins on his bedroom floor, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven BlanketsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds him comparing his failed relationship to a pair of lips (Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stuck like we were glued/A yawn, we split in twoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The melodies are whispered atop casual, homespun beats, making Everyday Balloons sound like a breakup album on painkillers. The ache is always there, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrounded by a gauzy sense of warmth -- and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to forget about the pain unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re consciously poking around for it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe1705e72f4d9254125e98f0248f0c66f7fe49f","amp;dn":"A+Weather+-+Everyday+Balloons+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe1705e72f4d9254125e98f0248f0c66f7fe49f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,225,112,94,114,244,217,37,65,37,233,143,2,72,240,198,111,127,228,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
