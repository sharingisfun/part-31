Aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, it will also be\n invaluable to professional economists and to those teaching in the field. The\n book is entirely self-contained, giving all the equilibrium theory and welfare\n economics needed to understand the analyses. The author covers the Arrow-Debreu\n economy, welfare economics and the measurement of inequality and poverty which\n lay the foundations and emphasise the important role played by information.\n Within the competitive economy, he examines commodity taxation, income taxation\n and tax reform in a certain environment. He goes on to study the public economics\n of uncertainty, and then treats public goods, externalities, imperfect competition\n and tax evasion as departures from the standard competitive assumptions and looks\n at their implication for public economics derived.\n\n Book Description\n This textbook provides a thorough treatment of all the central topics in public\n economics.
