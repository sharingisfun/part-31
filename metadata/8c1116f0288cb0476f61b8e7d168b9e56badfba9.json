This can happen even if an application was removed correctly with its own uninstaller - a special program provided by a vendor to uninstall the application.\n\n\nFull Uninstall is a professional application designed to uninstall unnecessary applications from your system.\n\nThe main function of the tool is the complete removing of programs from your computer. Full Uninstall monitors all changes made to the system during the setup process of a certain application. You can easily learn what file or registry entries were modified during the installation. Using these data, Full Uninstall completely removes an application when you order it to.\n\nThe program performs much faster than many competing solutions. This is because Full Uninstall analyzes changes on disks in real time while tracking the modifications installation procedures have made, instead of taking a long time saving info about all files before and after installation. Such an approach saves much time compared to other utilities.\n\nYou can setup Full Uninstall so that all applications installed in your system will be accessible with a single click of the notification area icon. Another click, and you can immediately remove an unnecessary program without opening the standard Programs and Features tool or searching for a built-in uninstaller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1116f0288cb0476f61b8e7d168b9e56badfba9","amp;dn":"Full+Uninstall+v2.12+Final+Portable+%28registred%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1116f0288cb0476f61b8e7d168b9e56badfba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,17,22,240,40,140,176,71,111,97,184,231,209,104,185,229,107,173,251,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
