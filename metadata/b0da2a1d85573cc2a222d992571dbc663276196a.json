Where to begin, where to begin. Alright guys, this is as bad as it gets. The takers now have overwhelmed the makers to the point of no return. But we must keep on fighting, for our cause is the right cause, and our values are American values. Please stop voting for these liberal Republicrats in the primaries. We were told that only Romney (because he is such a moderate) could beat Obama. Guess what, 2.5 million Republicans that voted for McCain, did not show up for Romney. The guy could not generate any passion because he had no core beliefs. Democrats on the other hand, God bless them, never disappoint the base, and their base came out for them in big numbers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0da2a1d85573cc2a222d992571dbc663276196a","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+Show+Podcast%2C+November+8th%2C+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0da2a1d85573cc2a222d992571dbc663276196a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,218,42,29,133,87,60,194,162,34,217,146,87,29,188,102,50,118,25,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
