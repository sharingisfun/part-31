Part film and part movement, The Corporation is transforming audiences and dazzling critics with its insightful and compelling analysis. Taking its status as a legal &quot;person&quot; to the logical conclusion, the film puts the corporation on the psychiatrist's couch to ask &quot;What kind of person is it?&quot; The Corporation includes interviews with 40 corporate insiders and critics - including Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Milton Friedman, Howard Zinn, Vandana Shiva and Michael Moore - plus true confessions, case studies and strategies for change.\n\n-------------\n\nThis is a high-compression XviD/Mp3 rip for people who are more concerned with fast download and/or smaller files than with getting the highest possible video and audio quality.
