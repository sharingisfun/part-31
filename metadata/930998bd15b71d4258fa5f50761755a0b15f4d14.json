So I pieced this together.  It includes:\n\nThe Psycho-Social\nViolent by Design\nVisions of Gandhi\nLegacy of Blood\nServants in Heaven, Kings in Hell\n\nIn Servants, tracks 4, 13, and 14 (Uncommon Valor, Outlive the War, and Gutta Music) have 2 copies.  When I first downloaded the album these were flawed files, and couldn&amp;#039;t play.  My brief attempts at removing them failed, so I just included them anyway.  The second copy of each is fine, however.  This is also why I had to re-upload this, the first time I forgot to move over the good files.  Apologies for any inconveniences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:930998bd15b71d4258fa5f50761755a0b15f4d14","amp;dn":"Jedi+Mind+Tricks+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"930998bd15b71d4258fa5f50761755a0b15f4d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,9,152,189,21,183,29,66,88,250,95,80,118,23,85,160,177,95,77,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
