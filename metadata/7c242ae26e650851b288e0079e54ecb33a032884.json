They have produced several demos (none of which are still produced commercially), three studio albums and eleven singles. Their first album, Thefakesoundofprogress, was originally recorded in a week for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£4,000 (GBP) and intended as a demo,[1] but the band re-recorded and re-released the album on a much wider scale through Columbia Records in the USA, although they remain with Visible Noise in the UK. They released Start Something in 2004, and Liberation Transmission in 2006, both to mixed reviews and commercial success.\n\n\n\nMembers\n\nIan Watkins\nJamie Oliver\nLee Gaze\nMike Lewis\nStuart Richardson\nIlan Rubin\n\n\nLostprophets -  Fake Sound of Progress (2001)\n\nLostprophets - Start Something (2004)\n\nLostprophets - Liberation Transmission (2006)\n\n\n\nSeed after you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c242ae26e650851b288e0079e54ecb33a032884","amp;dn":"Lostprophets+3+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c242ae26e650851b288e0079e54ecb33a032884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,36,42,226,110,101,8,81,178,136,224,7,158,84,236,179,58,3,40,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
