We hear about the Miss USA pageant fiasco, a KKK rally in South Carolina, Jennifer Aniston chiming in on the gay flag, and Anthony moves out to the poker table to talk with Von Decarlo about VonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growth after PatriceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, her new book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Speak Fluent Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the things women do to change men. They also talk about excuses in relationships, knowing your worth, sleeping around, past threesomes, what men go through to get laid, the female ego, the importance of sex, VonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, attempting to stay positive, and TACS wraps with Von and Ant discussing the Patrice documentary, letting past experiences cloud your judgement, and accepting differences of opinions.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17950c3dcaffd29eb22da4ddb1c10eae916e591e","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-06-30+Von+Decarlo+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17950c3dcaffd29eb22da4ddb1c10eae916e591e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,149,12,61,202,255,210,158,178,45,164,221,177,193,14,174,145,110,89,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
