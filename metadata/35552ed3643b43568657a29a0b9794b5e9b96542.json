And you can judge this comic by its cover. . . Popeye, Wimpy and Swee' Pea are the hilarious cast in the rollicking fun comic 'On the House.'\n \nThe backup feature with Sappo and Watasnozzle has to be seen to be believed for it's astonishing surrealness!\n \nPlus two Popeye-and one Swee' Pea-mini-features. All beautifully reproduced on high-quality paper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35552ed3643b43568657a29a0b9794b5e9b96542","amp;dn":"Classic+Popeye+%238","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35552ed3643b43568657a29a0b9794b5e9b96542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,85,46,211,100,59,67,86,134,87,162,154,11,151,148,181,233,185,101,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
