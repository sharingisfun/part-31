Self-made shipping magnate Christopher Black first spies Rebecca Bailey at a masquerade ball and is captivated by her refreshing naivete and sparkling beauty. \n\nShe's a stark contrast to the hollow behaviour of the ton and the guile of his former fiancÃƒÂ©e, but the closer he gets to her secrets, the further she pushes him away. A Cinderella with a secret... Rebecca is drawn to the charismatic Christopher from the first, but she cannot risk him discovering that she is really a housemaid impersonating an heiress. Her father's life depends on it. \n\nA Happily Ever After that could never be... When Christopher's investigation of the murder of his best friend leads him straight to Rebecca, he fears his ingenue may be a femme fatale in disguise. Now he must decide if he can trust the woman he's come to love, or if her secrets will be his downfall.\n\nGenre: Historical Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e10a82b451e15595d59485b6a3ccd260883056","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Masquerade+by+Tamara+Hughes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e10a82b451e15595d59485b6a3ccd260883056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,225,10,130,180,81,225,85,149,213,148,133,182,163,204,210,96,136,48,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
