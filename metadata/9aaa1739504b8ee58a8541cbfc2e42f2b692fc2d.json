Douro is not, however, a traditional documentary about the river and the city Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is much closer to the work of Walter Ruttmann, Dziga Vertov and the early Joris Ivens. Antoine de Baecque characterises the film as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“visual symphonyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and JosÃƒÂ© de Matos-Cruz has referred to it as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“geographical mosaicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which the director brings together a multiplicity of images Ã¢â‚¬â€œ often shot from strikingly unusual angles or reflected in the water Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of people, boats, trains, barges, bridges, houses, alleyways, ships, light and shadows, crashing waves, objects blowing in the wind and, above all, the river.\n\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Douro.Faina.Fluvial.1931.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 755 Kbps\nLength            : 913 MiB for 18mn 53s 408ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 256 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021810/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021810/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aaa1739504b8ee58a8541cbfc2e42f2b692fc2d","amp;dn":"Douro.Faina.Fluvial.1931.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aaa1739504b8ee58a8541cbfc2e42f2b692fc2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,170,23,57,80,75,142,229,138,133,65,203,252,46,66,242,182,146,252,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
