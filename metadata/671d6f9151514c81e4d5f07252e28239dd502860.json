But it has never been said that way; on the contrary, people's minds have been corrupted by creating a goal against nature, giving it beautiful names, &quot;supernature.&quot; And man was caught in this because of a very simple reason:\r\nThe nature of things is already where you are.\r\nIt is not an excitement and it is not a challenge and it does not call on you to prove your ego. It is not a faraway star. Mind wants for its nourishment something very difficult, something almost impossible. Only if you can achieve the impossible can you feel you are somebody special.\r\nEnlightenment is not a talent. It is not like somebody being born a painter or a poet or a scientist -- those are talents. Enlightenment is simply everybody's very source of life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671d6f9151514c81e4d5f07252e28239dd502860","amp;dn":"Osho_Om+Mani+Padme+Hum+%2311_Enlightenment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671d6f9151514c81e4d5f07252e28239dd502860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,29,111,145,81,81,76,129,228,213,240,114,82,226,130,57,221,80,40,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
