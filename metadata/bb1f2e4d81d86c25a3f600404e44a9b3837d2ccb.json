Now she's returned- to her old life, her family, her friends- before being banished back to the underworld... this time forever. \n\nShe has six months before the Everneath comes to claim her, six months for good-byes she can't find the words for, six months to find redemption, if it exists. \n\nNikki longs to spend these months reconnecting with her boyfriend, Jack, the one person she loves more than anything. But there's a problem: Cole, the smoldering immortal who first enticed her to the Everneath, has followed Nikki to the mortal world. And he'll do whatever it takes to bring her back- this time as his queen. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1f2e4d81d86c25a3f600404e44a9b3837d2ccb","amp;dn":"Everneath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1f2e4d81d86c25a3f600404e44a9b3837d2ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,31,46,77,129,216,108,37,163,246,0,64,78,68,169,179,131,125,44,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
