This year is going to be murder.\n\n\nLiving in the bleak majesty of Kathmandu, Zan Jensen is an American expatriate on the run from a scandalous past. Working for a fly-by-night adventure consulting service, Zan escorts tourists and thrill-seekers up the Himalayas' tallest and deadliest peaks. Along with Haskell Price, fellow climbing guide and mentor, the two partner up in a more sinister line of work: high-altitude grave robbing.\n\nStripping the bodies they find left at deadly altitudes of personal effects and right hands, Zan and Haskell shake down the families and friends of the dead for a hefty body return fee. When Price stumbles across the decades-old corpse of Sullivan Mars below the peak of Mount Everest, it puts the partners in the crosshairs of a global mystery that someone is all too willing to kill to keep secret.\n\nThe first chapter of a new crime thriller that stretches from rural America to the roof of the world from Christopher Sebela (Screamland: Death of the Party, Captain Marvel) and Ibrahim Moustafa (The Pound: Ghoul's Night Out).\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - Cages (2002) | (Dave McKean) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8991793&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8991793&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0395ffdf5560c56f761f84fd4431efcd067724f","amp;dn":"High+Crimes+%28%23001-005%29+%7C+%28Christopher+Sebela%29+%5BOngoing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0395ffdf5560c56f761f84fd4431efcd067724f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,57,95,253,245,86,12,86,247,97,248,79,212,67,30,252,208,103,114,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
