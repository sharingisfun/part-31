Falcon 4.0 was a game like no other and led to a \n     following like no other. Years of development produced an F-16 simulator\n     with legendary features such as a truly dynamic campaign engine, \n     unrivalled depth of avionics and remarkable levels of artificial \n     intelligence.\n\n     Quite simply, Falcon 4.0 was the most important game of its type in a \n     generation because it made gameplay intoxicating. This summer, \n     Lead Pursuit LLC, in association Graphsim Entertainment Inc., \n     brings the spirit of Falcon 4.0 back to life with a totally updated \n     simulator for 2005. Falcon 4.0: Allied Force pushes the boundaries once \n     again for today's demanding gaming enthusiast.\n\n    * Revamped graphics engine\n    * Reworked multiplayer engine\n    * Highly advanced artificial intelligence\n    * Reworked dynamic campaign engine\n    * Brand new theater of operations\n    * New high resolution models and cockpits\n    * Highly detailed terrain and airbases\n    * Intuitive User Interface\n\n\n  Install Notes:\n  --------------\n  1.)
