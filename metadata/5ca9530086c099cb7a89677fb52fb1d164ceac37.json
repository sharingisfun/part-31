They originally formed in 1964 without a &quot;Jill&quot; under a different name. Later they added lead singer Glenys Lynne and changed the group's name. The group included Clive Harding (bass), Till Hanamann (guitar), Bruce Barks (guitar), and Tony Hughes (drums). In South Africa, they had a hit song, &quot;Timothy&quot;. In 1968 they cracked the American charts with the song &quot;Master Jack&quot;, hitting the Billboard Hot 100 at no. 18 and reaching no. 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart.[1] The song also reached no. 5 on Cashbox and went to no. 1 in South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). The follow-up single, &quot;Mr. Nico&quot;, peaked at no. 98 in the United States.\n\n\nALBUMS\n\nA TIME FOR GIVING\nTHE HEART AND SOUL OF FOUR JACKS &amp; A JILL (2 DISC)\nTHE VERY BEST OF (VOL 1)\n\n\nALL TRACKS MP3 FORMAT, 160kbps\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!
