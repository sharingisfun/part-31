Daughter to a Nordic mother and Spanish father, she has been tutored in both Arabic learning and the ancient myth cycles of the north. But her widower father has been arrested by the Inquisition, and Mura is sold to a Genoese slaver. In the port of Savona, Mura's androgynous looks and unusual abilities fetch a high price. She is bought as a house slave for the powerful Medici, arriving in Florence as the city prepares for war against the French. When the family are forced to flee, Mura finds herself gifted to the notorious Tigress of Forli, Countess Caterina Sforza. Beautiful, ruthless and intelligent, the Countess is fascinated by Mura's arcane knowledge. As the Tigress educates her further in the arts of alchemy, potions and poisons, she becomes much more than a lady's maid. Mura becomes a potent weapon in the Machiavellian intrigues of the Renaissance court...\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3eb421d24b7540504fdb47a5a2248bbadd7e1a","amp;dn":"Lisa+Hilton+-+Wolves+in+Winter.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3eb421d24b7540504fdb47a5a2248bbadd7e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,62,180,33,210,75,117,64,80,79,219,71,165,162,36,139,186,221,126,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
