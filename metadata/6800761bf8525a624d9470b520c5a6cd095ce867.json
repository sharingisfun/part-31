The opener, &quot;I Want You Back,&quot; with its driving rhythm, sing along backups, and minor key, &quot;Stepping Stone&quot;-like chord progressions, heralds the Gurus' irresistible pop craft like a cannon blast. While singer-songwriter Dave Faulkner may wear his melodic-'60s-guitar rock-a la-The Byrds-and-The Beatles, late-'70s punk, roots-rock influences on his sleeve, he manages to synthesize these elements flawlessly into a hard-hitting, tuneful amalgam that is no less enjoyable for its familiarity.\n\nDarkly edgy, riff-driven jams such as &quot;Dig It Up&quot; and (Let's All) Turn On,&quot; conjure The Cramps, whereas &quot;My Girl&quot; evokes Top-40 bubblegum tunefulness, and the flat-out rock &amp; roll of &quot;I Was a Kamakazi Pilot&quot; touches everyone from the Stones to The New York Dolls. The Hoodoo Gurus follow closely in the footsteps of their musical forebears, but do so with enough skill, inventiveness, and attitude to make the mix delectable. STONEAGE ROMEOS is the first of the group's several fine albums.\n\n1.&quot;(Let's All) Turn On&quot;\n2.&quot;I Want You Back&quot;\n3.&quot;Arthur&quot;\n4.&quot;Death Ship&quot;\n5.&quot;Dig It Up&quot;\n6.&quot;My Girl&quot;\n7.&quot;Zanzibar&quot;\n8.&quot;Leilani&quot;\n9.&quot;Tojo&quot;\n10.&quot;In The Echo Chamber&quot;\n11.&quot;I Was A Kamikaze Pilot&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6800761bf8525a624d9470b520c5a6cd095ce867","amp;dn":"Hoodoo+Gurus+-+Stoneage+Romeos+%5B320k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6800761bf8525a624d9470b520c5a6cd095ce867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,0,118,27,248,82,90,98,77,148,112,181,32,197,166,205,9,92,232,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
