Little do the attendees know that LilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€and the nameless narrator of this striking novelÃ¢â‚¬â€is among them, and she has just walked off with a suitcase of LilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belongings.\n\nAbandoned by Lily many years ago, she has come a long way to learn about her mother, and the stolen suitcaseÃ¢â‚¬â€stuffed with clothes, letters, and photographsÃ¢â‚¬â€contains not only a history of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love life, but perhaps also the key to her own identity. As the tough, resourceful narrator tracks down her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former husbands, boyfriends, and acquaintances, a risky reenactment of her life begins to unfold. \n\nLily had a knack for falling in love with the wrong people, and one man, a fashion photographer turned paparazzo, has begun to work his sinuous charms on the young woman.\n\nTold with high style and noir-ish flare, Anna StothardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Pink Hotel is a powerfully evocative debut novel about wish fulfillment, reckless impulse, and how we discover ourselves.\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb541a1adaf0b46f31d4b25e4ba69182cdae5336","amp;dn":"The+Pink+Hotel+by+Anna+Stothard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb541a1adaf0b46f31d4b25e4ba69182cdae5336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,84,26,26,218,240,180,111,49,212,178,94,75,166,145,130,205,174,83,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
