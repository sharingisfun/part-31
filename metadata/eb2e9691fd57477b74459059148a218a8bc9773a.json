You're done, Office 2007 is genuine.\n\nThis .reg file will only work for MS Office 2007 Enterprise Edition.\n\nWhat it does:\nThis entitiy will overwrite the invalid Office 2007 Registry on your computer with a valid entity.  In effect, it removes the invalid key caused by using a &quot;fake&quot; CD key to install it and replaces it with a clean, Genuine Office Registry entity. This registry does not affect anything other than the Office 2007 key, so don't worry about your computer being messed up.\n\n\nWhy you should do it:\nWell, if you try to go to Microsoft Office and get genuine updates, Microsoft will block you, saying that your copy of Office is invalid, or even fake.  This isn't true; the CD key is fake, not the program.  This Reg Key will overwrite the invalid Office Key and replace it with a key that will tell Office and Windows update that the copy of Office is real, and it will let you download and install Genuine Updates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2e9691fd57477b74459059148a218a8bc9773a","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2007+Geniune+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2e9691fd57477b74459059148a218a8bc9773a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,46,150,145,253,87,71,123,116,69,144,89,20,138,33,138,139,201,119,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
