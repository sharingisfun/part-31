If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one sure bet in this town, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never be bored Ã¢â‚¬â€ even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pull a single slot handle.\nBut navigating your way through the sensory overload that is Sin City\nwithout exhausting yourself should be a priority; you are, after all, on\nvacation. All you need to ensure an enjoyable trip to Las Vegas is some\npatience, some advance planning, and a little luck (hitting it big can do\nwonders for oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mood).\nAbout This Book\nPay full price? Read the fine print? Do it their way?\nExcuse me. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need for any of that.\nYou picked this book because you know the For Dummies brand and you\nwant to go to Las Vegas. You also probably know how much you want to\nspend, the pace you want to keep, and the amount of planning you can\nstomach. You may not want to tend to every little detail, yet you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\ntrust just anyone to make your plans for you.\nIn this book, we give you the lowdown on Las Vegas, which challenges\nOrlando as the number-one tourist destination in the United States.\nRising from its modest beginning as a small, old-time gambling town, the\ncity has more hotel rooms than any other. And for sheer spectacle, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nhard to beat this town. Here you can watch a volcano explode, see a\npirate ship sink, stroll by the Eiffel Tower, and cross the Brooklyn Bridge.\nAnd did we mention that you can gamble?\nTo say that taking it all in can be overwhelming, and exhausting, would\nbe a massive understatement. No need to worry. As Vegas veterans with\nyears of experience, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve scoured the city from the Strip to downtown\nto find the best deals around. In this book, we guide you through Las\nVegas in a clear, easy-to-understand way, allowing you to find the best\nhotels, restaurants, and attractions without having to read the book like\na novel Ã¢â‚¬â€ cover to cover (although you can read this book cover to\ncover if you so choose). With this book, you can find the best and most\nessential ingredients for a winning vacation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c73facdccafac8c3dd41ab6fb7080211d20261f0","amp;dn":"Las.Vegas.for.Dummies.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c73facdccafac8c3dd41ab6fb7080211d20261f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,63,172,220,202,250,200,195,221,65,171,111,183,8,2,17,210,2,97,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
