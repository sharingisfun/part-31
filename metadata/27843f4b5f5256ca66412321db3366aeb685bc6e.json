The project approach inspires and captivates students; it involves them in the scientific experience, providing continuity to laboratory bench time and an understanding of the principles underlying the techniques presented.\nMolecular Biology is a must for any department, operating under budgetary constraints that offers or plans to offer a course in molecular cloning.\n\nKey Features\n* Includes a glossary of over 200 terms important for understanding molecular biology\n* Uses an inexpensive source of eukaryotic cells - great for schools on a budget\n* Includes Methods Locator that provides instant access to the latest methods\n* Contain clearly written, easy-to-follow, student-tested instructions:\n* Sterile techniques\n* Phage titration\n* Gel electrophoresis of DNA\n* Restriction enzyme digestion\n* Plasmid isolation\n* Transformation of E. Coli\n* Recombinant DNA cloning\n* Nick translation labeling\n* Nonradioactive primer labelling\n* Nonradioactive DNA detection\n* Southern blotting\n* Colony hybridization\n* Purification of plant DNA\n* RNA purification\n* Northern blotting\n* Purification of poly A+ RNA\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27843f4b5f5256ca66412321db3366aeb685bc6e","amp;dn":"Molecular+Biology+-+A+Project+Approach.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27843f4b5f5256ca66412321db3366aeb685bc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,132,63,75,95,82,86,202,102,65,35,33,219,51,102,174,182,133,188,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
