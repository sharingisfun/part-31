He has got that special elastic left hand-feeling, so hard to achive! Here you will find a collection of Boogie Woogie played by Norman.\n\nA few remarks on some of the tracks:\nAnitra's Dance Boogie Woogie (from 1949) is a Boogie Woogie on Grieg's Anitra's Dance. Rumours say this tune was censored and forbidden in Norway for a number of years. It was considered very inappropriate at that time to do a Boogie Woogie on the classical piece Anitra's Dance.\n\nBoogie 68, Media Lux and Let's Go are three hard driving, light swinging Boogie Woogies in Norman style.\n\nCharlie Norman died 12-Aug-2005.\n\nRest in Peace, Charlie. We all miss You.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02c4c562e23a33ad61711486c8fb86ce8584ddc","amp;dn":"Charlie+Norman+-+Boogie+Woogie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02c4c562e23a33ad61711486c8fb86ce8584ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,44,76,86,46,35,163,58,214,23,17,72,108,143,184,108,232,88,77,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
