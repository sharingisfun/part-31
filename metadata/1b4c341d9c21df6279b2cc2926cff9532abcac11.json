Refreshing insofar as the series is not weighed down with D.C. Universe baggage. One can easily access simple stories driven by complex characters.\n\nAll Star Western takes an interesting turn as Jonah Hex is integrated into the D.C. Universe, but maintains Hex's core character and morality that enables him to navigate the era of industrialization/urbanization as well as the 21st century.\n\nAlso included in the files are Hex's animated appearances in m4v format. If your media player has any issues, retitle the suffixes to mp4.\n\nCredit to the original digital rippers / editors.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4c341d9c21df6279b2cc2926cff9532abcac11","amp;dn":"Hex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4c341d9c21df6279b2cc2926cff9532abcac11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,76,52,29,156,33,223,98,121,178,204,41,38,207,249,83,42,188,172,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
