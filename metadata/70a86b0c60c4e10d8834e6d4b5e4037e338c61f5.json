This new amalgamated group is called PYPY (Ãâ‚¬ Ãâ‚¬), and this debut LP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pagan DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mind searing concoction of sinister wah-wah freakouts littered with fuzz, distortion and the necromantic scree of co-lead singer Annie-Claude DeschÃƒÂªnes. Super disco-breaks reminiscent of the dance punk of NYCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary 99 Records (ESG / Liquid Liquid) slither in on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daffodils,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the blistering pop of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rivals Thee Oh Sees most burning tracks. Add all of this to one of the finest recording sessions weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever heard here at Black Gladiator / Slovenly HQ, and you got yourself a prime moving platter for your heaviest rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll club soirees and claw-your-eyes-out solo home listening sessions.\ncredits\nreleased 11 February 2014\nBlack Gladiator / Slovenly Recordings 2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70a86b0c60c4e10d8834e6d4b5e4037e338c61f5","amp;dn":"PyPy+-+Pagan+Day+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70a86b0c60c4e10d8834e6d4b5e4037e338c61f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,168,107,12,96,196,225,13,136,52,230,212,181,228,3,126,51,140,97,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
