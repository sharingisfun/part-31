It is presented within the broad framework of a modern myth and poetry and tells the story of a young  punk Anarchist writer, who discovers the magickal nature of reality and so decides to write a book to spread awareness and spiritual anarchism. However it also heavily researched and like so many spiritualities, it uses this mythology as a vehicle for transmitting the mysteries, with the majority of the book being the prosaic teachings of the protagonist. It assumes no knowledge on the part of the reader and provides introductions to the topics discussed, before going on to more original and in depth ideas. While a history of spiritual anarchists and the theocratic black magicians that oppose them is given to provide context, this book focuses more on integrating mystical and magickal teachings from around the world and creating a detailed and modern  Anarchist spirituality that suits the individual. It also provides a variety of practical ritual meditative techniques for creating an Anarchist consciousness, as well as using magick for activist and Anarchist purposes. If you were ever looking for an Anarchist grimoire, this is it! One of the main themes of the book is the global use of psychedelics or â€œentheogensâ€ for spiritual purposes and how they can be utilized for overcoming the counter-revolutionary aspects of the mind and also how Occult techniques can be used to help direct the trips for expanding consciousness and performing magick. (especially DMT and Salvia Divinorum) Another primary theme is how language and â€œmemesâ€ apply to fractals, how Noam Chomsky's notion of â€œuniversal grammarâ€ was actually discovered by Occultists along with the scientific method, but also how language shapes human consciousness, politics and the world around us. Other topics include an Occult interpretation of the historical origins of the monetary and legal systems, as well as the origins of Judaism, Christianity and governments through theocracy. Inside you will find explanations for how art and â€œmemesâ€ can be used for Anarchist propaganda, how ritual and  magick apply to â€œneuroplasticityâ€ and how all these things can literally shape our brains either to create free will, or as a form of brainwashing. All this and much more is found within, while the epilogue explains groundbreaking political interpretations of â€œThe Cube of Space,â€ Solomonic magick, Enoch and the Watchers, Gnosticism and world mythology in general. Here the author shows how this mythology relates to meteorites and astronomical events, atomic theory, numerology and sacred geometry. It also gives advanced ideas on reconstructing an old world form of Alchemical Tantric Shamanism and how magick squares can be utilized with set theory to create the philosopher's stone in your brain! \r\n\r\n\r\nA chapter by chapter synopsis is given in the table of contents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe31d25db51039199578e14278c492d82a2dfe2","amp;dn":"The+Chronicles+of+Anarchy+%28Grimoire+of+Anarchist+Occultism+PDF%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe31d25db51039199578e14278c492d82a2dfe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,227,29,37,219,81,3,145,153,87,142,20,39,140,73,45,130,162,223,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
