It was a great line. He'd been released from the Louisiana State Pen one month shy of three years out of the &quot;five to twenty-five&quot; the judge handed him. Now he's working for his brother-in-law Leo at Mullens and Sons, a New Orleans mortuary. Working with dead people. It's amazing how fast a guy can sink. But one afternoon, Leo sends him on an errand to pick up a dead leper, and he meets Lucy, the best-looking nun he's ever laid eyes upon. Lucy has some crazy ideas of how they can get their hands on several million dollars that some nasty Nicaraguan colonel has stashed away for the contra rebels. She's smart, that's for certain, and he has the necessary elan. But they need a logistics man. That's where his buddy Roy comes in, an ex-cop/ex-con with a mean streak a mile wide. If their plan succeeds, the three of them are going to make out like bandits.\n\nJacket Copy (hardcover version):\nBandits assembles an unlikely crew: an ex-nun, an ex-cop, and an ex-con. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got their eyes on several million dollars that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve decided should not be sent to aid the Contras in Nicaragua. Of course, a lot of other people have their eyes on the money, too - including the CIA. But Lacy, Jack, and Roy have a plan. Their motives may differ, but one thing is certain: Together theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to make out like bandits.\n\nReview:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BanditsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ shows Leonard experimentingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just a littleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with his kind of entertainment to see what can be made of it. I like the result. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longer than his other books, the narrative roomier and more laid-back. The good bad guys (i.e., the sympathetic characters) are over the hill and inclined to reminiscence, and the really bad guys are for the first time foreignersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Nicaraguan contras. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as if Leonard, who has created so many memorable local, inner-city villains, had peeked beyond our borders and been struck by international awareness: out there lies a whole new source of violence and corruption. -Newsweek\n\nFrom Wiki:\nA 2001 comedy film, Bandits, was originally meant to be an adaptation of Leonard's novel by that name, to which Bruce Willis owns the film rights. However, the producers brought in writer Harley Peyton to write a new script from scratch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a680cbb06875696fce829158d91dc726cb40310e","amp;dn":"BANDITS+-+Elmore+Leonard.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a680cbb06875696fce829158d91dc726cb40310e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,128,203,176,104,117,105,111,206,130,145,88,217,29,199,38,203,64,49,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
