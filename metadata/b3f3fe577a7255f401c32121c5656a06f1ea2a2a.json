The first\nsigns of this transition were displayed on Comalies, but it wasnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t until\nKaramcode that it became blatantly obvious. Karmacode presented a band\nstruggling to move beyond minor league success even if it meant losing their own\nindividuality. It was an album that blatantly stole from nu metal and discarded\nmuch of what had made them previously appealing. Apparently the band didnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t\nachieve their desired results because Shallow Life continues their search for a\nmore profitable identity but this time theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve gone in a different, more\nlogical, direction. Shallow Life finds the band dropping the nu metal of\nKarmacode and moving towards mainstream metal similar to Linkin ParkÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s current\nsound - only instead of a rapper Lacuna Coil have Cristina Scabbia and instead\nof a whiney emo-boy they have a tone-deaf Italian.\n\nAll jokes aside, it would be easy to focus on how the band continue to be too\nreliant on other bandsÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  techniques but to do so would be to sell this album\nshort. Suffice it to say that they have definitely moved in a more mainstream\ndirection, but that they have finally found their niche as well. A look at the\nbandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s past should remind that theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve never really had great riffs, powerful\nvocals (male vocals, anyway), or engaging atmospheres; theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve only ever\nsucceeded on the strength of CristinaÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s voice (and looks) and a penchant for\nwriting moderately catchy tunes, and those are the qualities emphasized on this\nalbum. ThatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s not to say that the band has totally moved away from heavier\nsections (as the opening to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´I SurviveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ proves); itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s just that theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re now\nintermingled with melodic, unobtrusive riffs that take a back seat to strong\nchoruses.\n\nBy focusing on the chorus as the apex of each song, the band has managed to\ncreate some of the strongest hooks of their career. ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s the strong choruses\nthat save a few songs such as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´I Like ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ with its asinine lyrics and weak\nverses, and make them into something thatÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s still worth listening to. Another\nway the band have managed to accentuate their strengths is through the\nnear-constant use of subtle keyboard melodies and sound effects. These stylish\nflourishes work in tandem with the guitar riffs and strong choruses to create\nsongs that are memorable while still retaining the slightest edge. Of course,\nsome may see these influences as shortcomings but they really have helped the\nband move forward.\n\nThe bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s actual shortcoming is the same one that theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve had since their\ninception, the weak vocals of Andrea Ferro. Andrea still delivers his vocals the\nsame way that he always has - in an uncontrolled, atonal shout that lacks any\npower or grace. In his defense he does sound better than on previous albums, but\nthat probably has more to do with a larger budget to clean up his vocal\ndeficiencies than any actual increase in ability. Having said that, the few\ntimes where he is allowed to take the spotlight with minimal musical\naccompaniment, such as on ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´This MazeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, he is absolutely terrible; apparently no\namount of studio tricks can help him completely. Much less of a limitation is\nthat the band is obviously still getting used to their new style, causing them\nto occasionally introduce awkward lyrics or musical sections but theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re never\nbad enough to kill a song.\n\nLacuna CoilÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s shift into mainstream metal will probably be met with some\nbacklash by long-time fans, but most of it will be completely unwarranted. The\nband has only ever been good at a few things and deciding to emphasize those\nelements is a completely logical step. This focus has resulted in a good\ncollection of memorable songs that end up being an enjoyable listen. There will\nbe obvious complaints about a lack of heavy riffs, gothic influences and\nwhatever else theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve discarded, but the fact remains that they werenÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t good at\nthose things in the first place. At the end of the day, this album might not be\nwhat the change-resistant fans wanted to hear but it was necessary and more\nimportantly, they pull it off quite well.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f3fe577a7255f401c32121c5656a06f1ea2a2a","amp;dn":"Lacuna+Coil+-Shallow_Life-2009-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f3fe577a7255f401c32121c5656a06f1ea2a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,243,254,87,122,114,85,244,1,195,33,33,197,101,106,6,241,234,42,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
