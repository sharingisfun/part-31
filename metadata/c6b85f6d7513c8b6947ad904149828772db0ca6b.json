I don't mean to disparage Mr Coyne's nasal appendage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it certainly doesn't seem oversized on the photos accompanying the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but it sounds as though he's related to Cyrano de Bergerac or, more likely, Pinocchio after he's told a whole raft-load of lies! His nasal tone is not totally off-putting but it certainly is different. \n\nit's only when you play the album through a second and third time that the songs begin to take on a personality of their own. A mixture of swing, blues, folk and gospel with a cast of quaintly English characters and a narrator teetering on the edge of insanity Marjory Razorblade is a revelation. &quot;Marlene&quot;, &quot;Eastbourne Ladies&quot;, &quot;Cheat Me&quot;, &quot;Lovesick Fool&quot;, &quot;Jackie And Edna&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;House On The Hill&quot; are the tracks that are running through my head at the moment but that will, no doubt, change. And if you're looking for more examples of madness then you need go no further than &quot;Karate King&quot;, replete with suitable Kung Fu grunts, and &quot;Dog Latin&quot; in which it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Coyne is actually speaking in tongues. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/06/kevin-coyne/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/06/kevin-coyne/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b85f6d7513c8b6947ad904149828772db0ca6b","amp;dn":"Kevin+Coyne...Marjory+Razorblade%281973%29+CD%281990%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b85f6d7513c8b6947ad904149828772db0ca6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,184,95,109,117,19,200,182,148,122,217,4,20,152,40,119,45,176,202,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
