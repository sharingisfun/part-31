For the first time ever on a videogame system, Jackass the Game will give players the ability to take on the roles of Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and many others from the Jackass gang as they virtually manoeuvre through the types of off-the-wall madness and stunts that fans have previously only been accustomed to watching on their televisions and movie screens. The highly anticipated title has reunited some of the most notable cast members from the Jackass series and films for players to interact with and play as, providing hours of outrageous entertainment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54948fb0b012cb613954010a9bf4a88c3593d24","amp;dn":"Jackass+%5BEnglish%5D%5BPSP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54948fb0b012cb613954010a9bf4a88c3593d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,73,72,251,11,1,44,182,19,149,64,16,169,191,74,136,195,89,61,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
