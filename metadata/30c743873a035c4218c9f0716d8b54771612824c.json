Emphasizing the ROCK half of jazz-rock fusion, Vital Tech Tones brings together three monster players of the genre, blends their creative juices and virtuosic abilities, and creates a truly vital sound that reinvigorates and re-establishes fusion as a viable part of the musical landscape. Most of the songs on this recording started with drummer Steve Smith giving his rhythmic ideas to bassist-extraordinaire Victor Wooten, who developed a groove over which guitarist Scott Henderson worked melodies and harmonies. Such a simple, straight-forward, jam-oriented process is risky, but these three have the goods to pull it off, in the process creating a fresh electric music unique for its time.\n\nAlthough VTT has been a studio-only side project for these three, they interact here as though they&amp;#039;ve been on the road together for several years. It&amp;#039;s loud, it&amp;#039;s raw, and it&amp;#039;s awesome -- just what aging baby boomers need to cure their smooth jazz blues, just what generation X-ers need to take them away from the tedious sameness of the alt-rock world.\n\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork.
