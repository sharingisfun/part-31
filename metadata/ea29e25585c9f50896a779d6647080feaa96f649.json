It is a novel about money, sex, and power, set against the background of the politics of the French colonization of North Africa. It explores the dynamics of an urban society uncomfortably close to our own and is a devastating satire of the sleaziness of contemporary journalism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea29e25585c9f50896a779d6647080feaa96f649","amp;dn":"Bel+Ami%2C+a+novel+by+Henri+Ren%C3%83%C2%A9+Guy+de+Maupassant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea29e25585c9f50896a779d6647080feaa96f649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,41,226,85,133,201,245,8,150,167,121,214,100,112,128,254,170,150,246,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
