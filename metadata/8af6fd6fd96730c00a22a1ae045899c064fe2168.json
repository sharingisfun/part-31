Hulme was turned down by many publishing houses before she found a small publishing house in New Zealand called Spiral. In 1985 Spiral collaborated with English publishing house Hodder &amp; Stoughton.\n\nPlot description:\n\nIn a tower on the New Zealand sea lives Kerewin Holmes, part Maori, part European, an artist estranged from her art, a woman in exile from her family. One night her solitude is disrupted by a visitorÃ¢â‚¬â€a speechless, mercurial boy named Simon, who tries to steal from her and then repays her with his most precious possession. As Kerewin succumbs to Simon's feral charm, she also falls under the spell of his Maori foster father Joe, who rescued the boy from a shipwreck and now treats him with an unsettling mixture of tenderness and brutality. Out of this unorthodox trinity Keri Hulme has created what is at once a mystery, a love story, and an ambitious exploration of the zone where Maori and European New Zealand meet, clash, and sometimes merge.\n\nWinner of both a Booker Prize and Pegasus Prize for Literature, The Bone People is a work of unfettered wordplay and mesmerizing emotional complexity.\n\nReviews:\n\n&quot;This book is just amazingly, wondrously great.&quot;\n--Alice Walker\n\n&quot;An original, overwhelming, near-great work of literature&quot;\n--The Washinton Post Book World\n\n&quot;Unforgettably rich and pungent&quot;\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n&quot;This is quite a first novel. The ending is revealed at its mysterious beginning; exotic line breaks and poetic punctuation put off at first but gradually become the best way to tell the tale; the Maori vocabulary is interwoven with contemporary British, Australian, and American idioms; and the New Zealand sea- and landscape vibrate under fresh perception. Hulme shifts narrative points of view to build a gripping account of violence, love, death, magic, and redemption. A silverhaired, mute, abused orphan, a laborer heavy with sustained loss, and a brilliant intro spective recluse discover, after enormous struggle through injury and illness, what it means to lose and then regain a family. No wonder The Bone People won the Pegasus Prize. Highly recommended.&quot;\n--Library Journal\n\n-----\n\nThis is a reprocessed version of an older scan.
