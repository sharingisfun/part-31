But anyone who had liked SCOTS before would find lots to enjoy here and, if anything, the album broadens the group&amp;#039;s already-varied musical palette, adding a strong (and less jokey) straight-ahead country accent to &quot;My House Has Wheels&quot; and &quot;The Fly That Rose From Buffalo,&quot; and a cool R&amp;B flavor to &quot;Lordy Lordy&quot; and &quot;The Little Things.&quot; And if America had a better white trash party band in the 1990s than SCOTS, who were they? Rick Miller&amp;#039;s guitar work just keeps getting hotter with the passage of time, and his wild rides on &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; and &quot;Rumors of Surf&quot; are sheer trash rock heaven, while bassist Mary Huff and percussionist Dave Hartman give him all the firm support he needs. Ditch Diggin&amp;#039; is funny, it rocks, and you can even dance to it, and if that&amp;#039;s not your idea of a great album, then maybe you shouldn&amp;#039;t be bothering with this rock &amp; roll stuff in the first place.
