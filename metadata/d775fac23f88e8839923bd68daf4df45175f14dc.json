Lots of credits to the filesharers at those networks for keeping this great recording alive.\n\nAnyway, the CSR is a special recording that contains all the words and all the music from Les Miserables-The Musical, many songs like &quot;Master of the House&quot; and &quot;Wedding Chorale&quot; are now significantly expanded and the story makes much more sense now.\n\nAs far as the singers go it&amp;#039;s performed by an international cast pulled together from various countries, some better, some perhaps not quite &quot;up there&quot; with the best.
