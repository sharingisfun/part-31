Free Digitally, now!\n09/21/2011 11:10am\n\nA FREE DIGITAL COMIC THAT SERVES AS A PREQUEL TO THE NEW THRILLER IN THEATERS OCTOBER 14! \n\nDark Horse Comics is pleased to announce that it has created an exclusive digital comic to serve as a prequel to the thriller &quot;The Thing,&quot; in theaters October 14.  Starting today, the comic will be released in three parts on September 21, September 28 and October 5 and is available FREE online and via the free Dark Horse Comics mobile app.  The Thing: The Northman Nightmare tells the origin story of pioneering Norsemen who discover a shape-shifting creature that is hiding in a desolate village with few human survivors.\n\nIn December 1991, Dark Horse Comics first published The Thing From Another World #1.  In the style of Aliens, Predator and Terminator, Dark Horse Comics picked up where John CarpenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic 1982 film left off.  Now, 20 years later, Dark Horse shares a much earlier story about this creature from beneath the ice. \n\nTaking us into frigid Greenland, the comic introduces us to a group of Norsemen who find themselves caught in a game of survival when they discover a terrifying creature.  The shape-shifting monster has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being.  It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman.  And it hides somewhere in a desolate village with few human survivors, among them a strange group of women...\n\nThe Thing: The Northman Nightmare is written by Steve Niles (Criminal Macabre), with art by Patric Reynolds (Serenity), colors by Dave Stewart (Hellboy) and a cover by Menton3 (Silent Hill).  The Thing: The Northman Nightmare comes to readers as a prequel to Universal Pictures' upcoming prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6a606a5c18fed079b155e06ee333aeb4f8b336","amp;dn":"THE+THING+-+THE+NORTHMAN+NIGHTMARE+%282011%29+%28Nothing-Novus%29+REQUES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6a606a5c18fed079b155e06ee333aeb4f8b336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,106,96,106,92,24,254,208,121,177,85,224,110,227,51,174,180,248,179,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
