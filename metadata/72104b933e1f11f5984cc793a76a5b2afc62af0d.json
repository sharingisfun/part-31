The first part looks at the origins of the Celts in the Alps of central Europe.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/10/18/0f5de943f1d33a516e1d1a38de95bb6c.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAnthropologist Prof. Alice Roberts and archaeologist Neil Oliver go in search of the Celts - one of the world's most mysterious ancient people. In Britain and Ireland, we are never far from our Celtic past but in this series Neil and Alice travel much further afield, discovering the origins and beliefs of these Iron Age people in artefacts and human remains right across Europe, from Turkey to Portugal. What emerges is not a wild people on the western fringes of Europe, but a highly sophisticated tribal culture that influenced vast areas of the ancient world - and even Rome. Rich with vivid drama reconstruction, we recreate this pivotal time and meet some of our most famous ancient leaders - from Queen Boudicca to Julius Caesar - and relive the battles they fought for the heart and soul of Europe. Alice and Neil discover that these key battles between the Celts and the Romans over the best part of 500 years constituted a fight for two very different forms of civilisation - a fight that came to define the world we live in today.\r\n\r\nIn the first episode, we see the origins of the Celts in the Alps of central Europe and relive the moment of first contact with the Romans in a pitched battle just north of Rome - a battle that the Celts won and that left the imperial city devastated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72104b933e1f11f5984cc793a76a5b2afc62af0d","amp;dn":"The.Celts.Blood.Iron.and.Sacrifice.s01e01.EN.SUB.x265.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72104b933e1f11f5984cc793a76a5b2afc62af0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,16,75,147,62,31,17,245,152,76,199,147,167,106,91,42,252,98,175,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
