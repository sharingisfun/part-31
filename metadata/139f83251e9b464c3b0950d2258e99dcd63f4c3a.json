This second book in the successful FOCUS series unlocks a doorway to the imagination, with a collection of approximately 250 photographs of passages of all kinds, captured by amateur photographers.\nDoors are rich in meaning: they literally allow us to move from one place to the other, but also symbolize temptation, invitation, separation, and mystery. For these reasons, as well as their physical beauty, photographers have found them irresistible. From a graffiti-scrawled urban door and an aged barn door to an elegant glass door glowing with dappled light and a curious circular door set into an ivy-covered rock wall, these images redefine the ordinaryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and shine a new light on the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139f83251e9b464c3b0950d2258e99dcd63f4c3a","amp;dn":"Focus+Passages+-+Your+World%2C+Your+Images+%28Photography+Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139f83251e9b464c3b0950d2258e99dcd63f4c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,159,131,37,30,155,70,76,59,9,80,210,37,142,153,220,214,63,76,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
