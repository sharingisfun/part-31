This movie is the historically accurate story about the Libyan resistance leader, Omar Mukhtar, who led the Libyan resistance against the Italian oppressors from 1911-1931. The movie takes place during the reign of Mussolini.\n\nInspirational in the resistance towards the oppressors is the leadership of one man - Omar Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn). A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar has committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his own lifetime. Arrogant imperialist and ideological visionary - the conflict is between two implacable enemies. Graziani controls North Africa with the might of the Italian Army. Tanks and airplanes are used in the desert for the first time. Despite their bravery, the Libyan Arabs and Berbers suffered heavy losses, their primitive weaponry no match for mechanized warfare; despite all this, they continued the fight, and managed to keep the Italians from achieving complete victory for twenty years. \n\n(http://www.islamictorrents.net)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dbae3e9f7850ccea5b6e8193a1190ffe09f6973","amp;dn":"Lion+of+the+Desert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dbae3e9f7850ccea5b6e8193a1190ffe09f6973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,186,227,233,247,133,12,206,165,182,232,25,58,17,144,255,224,159,105,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
