It is the second title by British independent developer Hello Games.[4] According to Hello Games's managing director, it is &quot;kind of&quot; a sequel to the successful Joe Danger.[6] The game was announced in August 2011[7] and released for Xbox Live Arcade on 14 September 2012,[4] and 9 October 2012 for PlayStation Network.[3]\nPlot\n\nJoe has gained favor with a movie director in Hollywood and is brought on to perform all the stunts on set.[8] The movie consists entirely of cliche action stunts and so he must perform chase scenes on mini carts, skis, and police bikes.[8]\nDevelopment and marketing\n\nFollowing the commercial success of Joe Danger, Hello Games began to run job adverts on their website, indicating work on a new project.[9] They began to hire and moved offices towards the end of the year.[10][11] After an announcement on Hello Games' website the week before, Joe Danger: The Movie, as it was then known, was presented for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne in August 2011.[7] The game will have similar gameplay, but will take place on the set of a film about the daredevil;[5] players will complete objectives unique to each level set by a &quot;mysterious director&quot;.[12] IGN noted that the premise is a &quot;good excuse&quot; to parody famous scenes from certain films.[13] Murray told Matt Miller of Game Informer that the game is &quot;kind of&quot; a sequel to Joe Danger, but that he envisioned the game as big enough to dwarf the original.[6] He indicated the game will involve &quot;a load of vehicles&quot; in a variety of locales.[14] At the Penny Arcade Expo, the game was presented on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, which Stephen Totilo of Kotaku interpreted as a broadening of scope for the studio;[5] a promotional image released with the announcement indicated Hello were unsure of how it would be released.[2] The game was eventually released on 14 September 2012.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeee2721495f0e4b13bf58e4d2709087e4159e42","amp;dn":"PS3+Joe+Danger+2+-+The+Movie+%5BNPUB31064%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeee2721495f0e4b13bf58e4d2709087e4159e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,238,39,33,73,95,14,75,19,191,88,228,210,112,144,135,228,21,158,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
