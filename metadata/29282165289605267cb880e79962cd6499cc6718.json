In addition, the trio had amassed a healthy amount of both studio and live B-sides, plus songs that only appeared on soundtracks. For the 1993 four-CD box set Message in a Box: The Complete Recordings, every single song the Police ever recorded is included. All the tracks were digitally remastered for the project, sounding superior to the original CD versions of the single albums. Also included is a 68-page booklet that includes an interesting (and often humorous) biography, a time line, and notes from all three bandmembers regarding the rarities that appear for the first time on compact disc here. But of course, the real charm of the box set is the music -- album tracks (&quot;Hole in My Life, It's Alright for You, Driven to Tears), hits (Message in a Bottle, Can't Stand Losing You, Spirits in the Material World), and rarities (Fallout, a live version of Next to You) are all timeless classics. While the set is highly recommended to newcomers just discovering the wonders of the Police, longtime fans should consider replacing their tinny-sounding single CDs with the definitive Message in a Box. After all, it contains a total of 24 tracks unavailable (for the most part) anywhere else. - Greg Prato\n\n\n# Source: Audio CD\n# Original Release Date: September 28, 1993\n# Number of Discs: 4\n# Label: A&amp;M Records\n# Catalog: #540150\n# ASIN: B000002G23 \n\n\nDisc: 1\n\n1.
