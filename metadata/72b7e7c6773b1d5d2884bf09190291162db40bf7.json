This book traces the history of bacteria, from the development of life on earth to the evolution of diversity. It is this diversity that led, almost automatically to the development of pathogens as well as antibiotics. If we are to create long term antibiotics we must design them with this history in mind.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 236 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (November 14, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1402066252\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1402066252","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72b7e7c6773b1d5d2884bf09190291162db40bf7","amp;dn":"The+Bacteria%3ATheir+Origin%2CStructure%2CFunction+and+Antibiosis%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72b7e7c6773b1d5d2884bf09190291162db40bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,183,231,198,119,59,29,93,40,132,191,9,25,2,145,22,45,180,11,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
