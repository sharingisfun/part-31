Suzanne (Kristin Scott Thomas) is in her mid-forties and married to Samuel (Yvan Attal), a successful doctor who is the father of their two teenage children (Alexandre Vidal and Daisy Broom). The love between Suzanne and Samuel is dead and their marriage is largely a matter of formalities, and to ease her boredom Suzanne has decided to resume her former career as a therapist. Samuel has agreed to foot the bills for building an office for Suzanne in their home, and he hires Ivan (Sergi Lopez) to help with the work. Ivan is a ruggedly handsome illegal immigrant, and Suzanne is immediately attracted to him; she promptly jumps head-first into an affair with him, and while their hunger for one another is clearly just physical, she decides to leave her family behind to live with Ivan. Even though Samuel doesn't much care for Suzanne, he's furious at the notion of her leaving him for another man, leading to an ugly conflict between the husband, the wife and the lover. Partir (aka Leaving) was an official selection at the 2009 BFI London Film Festival. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Partir.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 391 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1 933 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.875\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.280\n      Stream size : 1.11 GiB (81%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.3.0.dev55\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 263 MiB (19%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315962/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315962/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by magis\n\nCatherine Corsini - Partir (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e529b2cfece93074e9c3fe39a88320f63ad6ec4","amp;dn":"Catherine+Corsini+-+Partir+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e529b2cfece93074e9c3fe39a88320f63ad6ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,82,155,44,254,206,147,7,78,156,63,227,154,136,50,15,99,173,110,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
