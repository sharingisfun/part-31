The charming title track &quot;Tell 'Em Who We Are&quot; makes headway in to the calmer waters of Royksopp whilst &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; assisted by the emotive Imogen Heap on vocals is a claustrophobic, twisting, analogue breakbeat lope reminiscent of the Crystal Method.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f227425bf0261dd07eb7f2988a91d38654e334","amp;dn":"LHB+-+Tell+%5C%27Em+Who+We+Are+%282002%29+CDRip+128kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f227425bf0261dd07eb7f2988a91d38654e334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,242,39,66,91,240,38,29,208,126,183,242,152,138,145,211,134,84,227,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
