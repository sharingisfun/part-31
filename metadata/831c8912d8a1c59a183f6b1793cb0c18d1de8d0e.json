It was first broadcast on terrestrial channel BBC Two from February to March 1971, and was later broadcast in America on the premiere season of PBS's Masterpiece Theatre. \n\nThis acclaimed series is considered to be a largely accurate historical portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I of England unlike some later historical dramas portraying the Tudor dynasty such as The Tudors, The Other Boleyn Girl and Elizabeth, The Golden Age which contain many inaccuracies.\n\nThe series was essentially a follow-up to the successful Six Wives of Henry VIII of 1970. Bernard Hepton as Cranmer, Basil Dignam as Bishop Gardiner, John Ronane as Thomas Seymour, and Rosalie Crutchley as Catherine Parr, reappeared in the same roles in Elizabeth R.\n\nGlenda Jackson's tour de force performance in the title role won her 2 Emmy Awards - for Best Actress in a Drama Series and Best Actress in a Movie/TV Special (for the episode &quot;Shadow in the Sun&quot;). The series itself won the Emmy for the Best Dramatic Series of 1972.\n\nCostume designer Elizabeth Waller recreated many of the historical Elizabeth's actual gowns for Glenda Jackson, adapting them from a number of the Queen's famous, official portraits.\n\n\nCast\n\nGlenda Jackson - Elizabeth \nRobert Hardy - Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester \nRonald Hines - Sir William Cecil \nMichael Williams - Francois, Duke of Anjou \nRobin Ellis - Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex \nStephen Murray - Sir Francis Walsingham \nJohn Shrapnel - Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex \nJason Kemp - Edward VI of England \nDaphne Slater - Queen Mary \nVivian Pickles - Mary, Queen of Scots \nHamilton Dyce - Amyas Paulet \nRachel Kempson - Kat Ashley \nPeter Jeffrey - King Philip of Spain \nDavid Collings - Anthony Babington \nBernard Holley - Gilbert Gifford \nJohn Woodvine - Sir Francis Drake \nJohn Nettleton - Sir Francis Bacon \nAngela Thorne - Lettice Knollys \nJames Laurenson - Simier \nHugh Dickson - Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury \nNicholas Selby - Sir Walter Raleigh \nMargaretta Scott - Catherine de' Medici \nJohn Ronane - Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley \nBernard Hepton - Archbishop Cranmer \nBasil Dignam - Bishop Gardiner \nRosalie Crutchley - Catherine Parr \nBrian Wilde - Richard Topcliffe.\n\n\nEpisode 1 - The Lion's Cub\n\nThe fragile succession heralds dangerous times for the young Princess Elizabeth.

Will Elizabeth survive her emotionally unstable half-sister's reign? Or die, as so many other Protestants did, under the reign of &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:831c8912d8a1c59a183f6b1793cb0c18d1de8d0e","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+R+-+Episode+1+of+6+%28BBC+1971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"831c8912d8a1c59a183f6b1793cb0c18d1de8d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,28,137,18,216,161,197,154,24,63,107,23,147,203,12,24,209,222,141,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
