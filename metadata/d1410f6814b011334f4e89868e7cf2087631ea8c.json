My name is Casey Kasem and this is our weekly countdown of the forty best-selling songs in the USA. This week's four new survey songs are by artists who are not strangers to the countdown. We're about to hear the latest hits by Judy Collins, Foghat, Chicago, and Rita Coolidge, not to mention thirty-six others of the most popular songs in America this week, including a brand new number one. And the countdown begins.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey says he can't remember having had this many female solo artists in the countdown. There are eight.\n\nSo far in the 70's, only two acts have been able to put an album in the top ten each year of the decade. One is The Rolling Stones. The other is in this countdown.\n\nElvis Presley is in the countdown with his hit song, &quot;Way Down,&quot; released only a few weeks before his death on August 16th of 1977. In fact, if you ever thought Ronnie McDowell's song, &quot;The King Is Gone&quot; (at number 15) was kind of corny like I did; you won't think that anymore after hearing Casey tell the backstory.\n\nThere is a hit by a group that has had eight different line-ups of members since they first began hitting the chart seven years prior; more than any other group before.\n\nOne song in the countdown ties for longest occupant of the top ten since &quot;Mack The Knife&quot; spent 16 weeks there nineteen years earlier.\n\nIn the preceding twenty years, no song ever had two versions hit the top ten during the same chart run, until a former number one hit in this countdown made the top ten.\n\n40:    Send In The Clowns - \n39:    Cat Scratch Fever - Ted Nugent\n38:    The Greatest Love Of All - George Benson        \n37:    I Just Want To Make Love To You - Foghat     \n36:    Blue Bayou - Linda Ronstadt     \n35:    Baby, What A Big Surprise - Chicago    \n34:    We Just Disagree - Dave Mason\n33:    Do You Wanna Get Funky With Me - Peter Brown\n32:    Were All Alone - \n31:    Dusic - Brick\n30:    Jungle Love - The Steve Miller Band\n29:    She Did It - Eric Carmen    \n28:    Way Down - Elvis Presley\n27:    I Believe You - Dorothy Moore\n26:    Help Is On The Way - Little River Band\n25:    Strawberry Letter 23 - The Brothers Johnson\n24:    How Deep Is Your Love - The Bee Gees\n23:    Don't Stop - Fleetwood Mac\n22:    Just Remember I Love You - Firefall\n21:    Surfin' USA - Leif Garrett\n20:    Signed, Sealed And Delivered - Peter Frampton\n19:    Heaven On The 7th Floor - Paul Nicholas\n18:    Telephone Line - Electric Light Orchestra\n17:    Best Of My Love - The Emotions\n16:    It Was Almost Like A Song - Ronnie Milsap\n15:    The King Is Gone - Ronnie McDowell\nEXTRA:  Mandy - Barry Manilow\n14:    It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down - Barry White\n13:    Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue - Crystal Gayle\n12:    On And On - Stephen Bishop\n11:    Swayin' To The Music (Slow Dancin') - Johnny Rivers\n10:    I Just Want To Be Your Everything - Andy Gibb\n9:    I Feel Love - Donna Summer\nEXTRA: Ben - Michael Jackson\n8:    Brick House - The Commodores\n7:    Cold As Ice - Foreigner\n6:    Boogie Nights - Heat Wave\n5:    Star Wars Title Theme - Meco\n4:    That's Rock 'N' Roll - Shaun Cassidy\n3:    Nobody Does It Better - Carly Simon\n2:    Keep It Comin' Love - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n1:    You Light Up My Life - Debby Boone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1410f6814b011334f4e89868e7cf2087631ea8c","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_October_15th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1410f6814b011334f4e89868e7cf2087631ea8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,65,15,104,20,176,17,51,79,78,137,134,142,124,242,8,118,49,234,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
