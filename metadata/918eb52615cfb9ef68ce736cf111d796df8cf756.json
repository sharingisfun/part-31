No Angel\n \neISBN: 978-1-590-20798-7 -- (2000)\n \nWith more than 3.5 million copies sold, Penny Vincenzi is one of the world's preeminent writers of popular fiction-and American readers no longer have to miss out on the fun. With the publication of No Angel, a novel introducing the engaging cast of characters in the Lytton family, Overlook opens a thrilling new dimension to this author's already illustrious career.\n \nNo Angel is an irresistibly sweeping saga of power, family politics, and passion-a riveting drama and a fervent love story. Celia Lytton is the beautiful and strong-willed daughter of wealthy aristocrats and she is used to getting her way. She moves through life making difficult and often dangerous decisions that affect herself and others-her husband, Oliver, and their children; the destitute Sylvia Miller, whose life is transformed by Celia's intrusion; as well as Oliver's daunting elder sister, who is not all she appears to be; and Sebastian Brooke, for whom Celia makes the most dangerous decision of all.\n \nSet against the tumultuous backdrop of London and New York in the First World War, No Angel is, as British Good Housekeeping wrote, &quot;an absorbing page-turner, packed with believable characters and satisfyingly extreme villains, eccentrics, and manipulators.&quot; Readers of Maeve Binchy, Barbara Taylor Bradford, and Anita Shreve will fall in love with this epic, un-put-downable novel. \n\n\n\n2. Something Dangerous\n \neISBN: 978-1-590-20796-3 -- (2001)\n \nIn No Angel, we met the Lytton family. Oliver, the head of Lyttons, a young and eager publishing company; his clever, strong-willed wife Celia whose combination of toughness and frailty is intensely endearing - her leading role in Lyttons is unusual but vital; Oliver's sister LM, a match for Celia in strength but with her own vulnerabilities; and Oliver and Celia's children: Giles, the twins and Barty, the child Celia took from the slums. Now, having survived the Great War, the family moves further into the new century, living, working and loving as best they can. Their story is incredibly powerful and utterly engrossing.\n \n\n\n\n3. Into Temptation\n \neISBN: 978-1-590-20800-7 -- (2002)\n \nThe Second World War is over, peace has been declared but the ravages remain and the Lytton family must confront the future and themselves. Kit Lytton, blinded in his early twenties in service for the RAF, is coming to terms with the fact that his father is not Oliver Lytton, as he thought, but the famous children's author Sebastian Brooke. His sense of betrayal is immense, but worse is the discovery that the woman he loves is his sister. Barty Miller is now in the curious position of owning a majority share of Lyttons, the publishing house belonging to the family that brought her up. Now rich and powerful, though alone, Barty is far from the cowed slum child rescued by Celia Lytton years before. But how will she act now towards the family who always made her feel she did not belong? And what secrets in the Lytton past remain to be discovered?\n \n\nepub | mobi | v5 (Retail)\n\n\n\n\nThe Best of Times by Penny Vincenzi\n \n\nIn a matter of seconds, absolutely everything can change ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n \nIn this masterfully crafted page-turner, peopled with intense characters and centered on one devastating moment that involves them all, plot-twist queen Penny Vincenzi vividly captures how the actions of one person can dramatically affect many in the blink of an eye.\n \nOn an ordinary Friday afternoon, on a major motorway outside of London, a trailer truck suddenly and violently swerves across fives lanes of trafficÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½careening cars into one another like dominoes and leaving a trail of chaos and confusion. Within the space of a minute, an astounding miles-long pileup has amassed, and, as the survivors await help, their stories unfold.\n \nVincenzi expertly maneuvers the plot between the panic-stricken husband trapped in his car with his young mistress, his adultery sure to be discovered; the bridegroom trying frantically to get to the church on time (he wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t); the widow on her way to reunite with the love of her life after sixty years, now forced to ponder whether sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ever see him again; the junior doctor waiting to receive the crash victims in the ER ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ And at the epicenter of this field of destruction lies the truck driver, suffering from memory loss, while the mysterious hitchhiker, the only person who knows what really happened, has fled the scene.\n \nSpellbound by these intimate and evocative tales, we watch as fate takes its powerful course and the far-reaching effects of the crash ripple through the lives of hundreds of people. Written with incredible verve, candor, and wit, Penny Vincenzi reveals human behavior in all its fascinating detail as she challenges her characters to face crisis boldlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and she surprises us with the results at every turn.\n \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918eb52615cfb9ef68ce736cf111d796df8cf756","amp;dn":"Penny+Vincenzi-Spoils+of+Time+Series%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918eb52615cfb9ef68ce736cf111d796df8cf756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,142,181,38,21,207,185,239,104,206,115,108,241,17,215,150,223,140,247,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
