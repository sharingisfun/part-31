Supported by all IDEs and build systems, it empowers programmers to deliver software features reliably and efficiently. However, writing good unit tests is a skill that needs to be learned; otherwise it's all too easy to end up in gridlocked development due to messed up production and testing code. Acquiring the best practices for unit testing will help you to prevent such problems and lead your projects to success with respect to quality and costs.\n\nThis book explains JUnit concepts and best practices applied to the test first approach, a foundation for high quality Java components delivered in time and budget.\n\nFrom the beginning you'll be guided continuously through a practically relevant example and pick up background knowledge and development techniques step by step. Starting with the basics of tests organization you'll soon comprehend the necessity of well structured tests and delve into the relationship of requirement decomposition and the many-faceted world of test double usage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db63c3b563f615d8ea5e89b464ee94d5f7dd0d4","amp;dn":"Testing+with+Junit+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db63c3b563f615d8ea5e89b464ee94d5f7dd0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,182,60,59,86,63,97,93,142,165,232,155,70,78,233,77,95,125,208,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
