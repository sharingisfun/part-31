Has your computer slowed down over time? Give it maintenance, not patience! Your PCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best days are still yet to come. Clean it up. Tune it up. Free your PC to perform at its best! Throughout its life, your PC accumulates programs, logs, junk files, cookies and other scraps that stick around long after they are needed. All they really do is weigh down your memory and processor.\n\n\n\n Features:\n\n Lightens your computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s load: The System Cleanup module includes a complete set of tools that swiftly and safely clear out PC clutter. Recover significant amounts of wasted space with a Junk Files Cleaner, Registry Cleaner and Smart Defragmenter. Activate the Privacy Cleaner to clear out the data downloaded in your everyday web browsing.\n Goes to the source of slowness, freezes and crashes: All PCs must run a number of processes behind the scenes. As new applications are added, background activity can grow chaotic, resulting in errors and hanging. The System Optimizer, complete with a Process Manager and Service Manager, puts wayward PC processes back on track. The Startup Manager speeds up boot time by limiting the number of tasks performed while Windows loads.\n Leaves no souvenirs of the past: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your PCÃ¢â‚¬â€you should have the final word as to which files can be accessed by others. File Encryption keeps current files on lockdown against prying eyes, while the File Shredder and Disk Wiper ensure that deleted items cannot be recovered. The Uninstaller allows no remnants of removed applications to waste space on your machine or cause errors in the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f138afc127b0a3eb180f856fe307838b48baab67","amp;dn":"Avira+System+Speedup+v1+6+6+1094","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f138afc127b0a3eb180f856fe307838b48baab67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,56,175,193,39,176,163,235,24,15,133,111,227,7,131,139,72,186,171,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
