Bible scholar Dr Francesca Stavrakopoulou thinks so. In the final episode of her series re-examining conventional readings of the Bible, she argues that the Garden of Eden has nothing to do with the origins of humanity, but is rather a story concealing dramatic events about a particular figure in a particular place, two and half thousand years ago.\n\nMarshalling compelling evidence from archaeology, Islam and the Bible text itself, she identifies and visits the exact site of Eden.\n\nIt's a revolutionary theory which challenges some of the most cherished preconceptions about Eden in both Christianity and western culture.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1920*1080i to 1280*720p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:821aff43ea6c05ba3727969f2d8b7bf453bd24dc","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Bible%5C%27s+Buried+Secrets+-+The+Real+Garden+of+Eden+x264+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"821aff43ea6c05ba3727969f2d8b7bf453bd24dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,26,255,67,234,108,5,186,55,39,150,159,45,139,123,244,83,189,36,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
