Well, it\\\\\\'s not very normal and you can clearly hear the Chinese inspirations on this one. \nOf course, Gorillaz have also set their marks on the monkey-tastic musical, as well has The Good The Bad And The Queen. \nIf you were looking for ethnic monkey music, you\\\\\\'ve come to the right place.\n(btw, am I the only one that thinks the cover is kinda friggin scary?)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ed9e355d159e383a905f592fb9e10fec32c67f","amp;dn":"Monkey+%28Damon+Albarn+of+Gorillaz%29+-+Journey+To+The+West+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ed9e355d159e383a905f592fb9e10fec32c67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,237,158,53,93,21,158,56,58,144,95,89,47,185,225,15,236,50,198,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
