Of Harrison's three number one singles in \nthe U.S., this was the only song not written by Harrison, and the only one \nwithout religious overtones. Not only was this the last US number one hit \nby Harrison, but of any from the other Ex-Beatles in the US. This second \npromo video was directed by Gary Weis, and has Harrison sitting and playing \nin a study. As the song progresses, furniture and knick-knacks (like a stuffed \nsquirrel and mounted warthog) begin to dance along with the song. In the middle \nof the video, Harrison's stunt double performs a backflip from his chair and \nfollows with a dance routine before jumping back to his seat. This second promo \nreceived significant airplay, and was nominated for three MTV VMAs.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mind_Set_on_You&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mind_Set_on_You&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:03:50\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
