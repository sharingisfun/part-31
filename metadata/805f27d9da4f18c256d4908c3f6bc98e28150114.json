The song is #89 in Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe Beach Boys -- two cover versions. One was released on a Radio Shack sampler cassette Rock 'N' Roll City in 1983 and a re-recorded version appeared on the CD Made in The USA (1986) The music video for this latter version features cameo appearances by John Phillips, Michelle Phillips (Mamas and Papas) and Roger McGuinn (The Byrds). McGuinn also contributes a 12-string guitar solo on that version. \n\nAccording to John Phillips in a Bravo documentary, and Michelle in an NPR piece, the song was written in 1963 while they were living in New York. He dreamed about the song and woke her up to help him write. She had stopped in St. Patrick's a few days earlier, which led to the second verse. At the time, the Phillipses were members of the folk group The New Journeymen which evolved into The Mamas and the Papas.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805f27d9da4f18c256d4908c3f6bc98e28150114","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+California+Dreamin%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805f27d9da4f18c256d4908c3f6bc98e28150114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,95,39,217,218,79,24,194,86,212,144,140,63,107,201,142,40,21,1,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
