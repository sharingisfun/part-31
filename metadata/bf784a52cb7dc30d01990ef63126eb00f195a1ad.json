The short stories include The Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Masque of the Red Death, and The Fall of the House of Usher. This release also features additional poetry by Poe and a new biography especially written for Naxos AudioBooks by Roy McMillan.\n\nThis collection of 8 short stories, 23 poems, and a short biography of Poe is narrated by three readers: John Chancer, William Roberts, and Kerry Shale. \nShale begins with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Murders in the Rue Morgue.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He employs a high-pitched French accent to represent Dupin and affects a surprised, somewhat immature tone for the narrator. Some of PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s endless descriptions bog down the pacing. Listeners may want to head right to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Pit and the Pendulum,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ read by Roberts, who is a master of the verbal adrenaline rush. His tones lower as the pendulum descends and speed up to match the petrified shrieks. \nShale recites the poetry selections; cue up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLenoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and zip over to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe RavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to experience a perfect audible pairing of love lost and unmitigated grief. Chancer provides a simple yet engaging reading of PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biography. \n\nSuitably macabre mood music marks transitions between the selections. The celebration of PoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 200th birthday brings renewed \n\ninterest in the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s works.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf784a52cb7dc30d01990ef63126eb00f195a1ad","amp;dn":"THE+ESSENTIAL+EDGAR+ALLAN+POE.+Naxos+Audiobooks+2008+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf784a52cb7dc30d01990ef63126eb00f195a1ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,120,74,82,203,125,195,13,1,153,14,246,49,38,235,0,241,149,161,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
