He was the sixth and last child of Le Roy and Julia Smith, who were sharecroppers. Rhodes began playing seriously when he was 12, although he got his first guitar when he was eight as a Christmas present. Rhodes began performing around Smithville and nearby Austin in the late '50s, while still in his teens. Rhodes lists as his guitar influences T-Bone Walker, Pee Wee Crayton and B.B. King among others. He learned to play lap steel guitar from Oakland bluesman L.C. 'Good Rockin'' Robinson.\n\nSonny Rhodes is such a talented songwriter, so full of musical ideas, that he's destined to inherit the to seats left open by the untimely passing of blues greats like Albert King and Albert Collins. He has recorded over two hundred songs and has been nominated eleven times for the Blues Music Awards.\n\n&quot;I'm what you call a self-proclaimed disciple of the blues!&quot; said Rhodes about his years playing and singing for fans of blues around the world. He first toured Europe in 1976 and then many more times and was recorded by several European labels.\n\n\n\n01. Mean Mistreatin' Mama (7:22)\n02. I'm So Lonely (10:28 )\n03.
