Tales claim it kills animals in the dark of night, ripping their throats apart and drinking their blood. Many a farmer or villager has found his livestock dead and drained of blood come dawn. But in one Texas town, it is no longer the livestock that need to worry after dark. Humans seem to have taken their place as the Chupacabra's prey...and it's up to one Monster Hunter to find out why and stop it if he can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c8f03d4f57777a93da966759b1f4da6a2c57127","amp;dn":"The+Monster+Hunter%27s+Survival+Guide+-+Case+Files+-+Chupacabra+%5BG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c8f03d4f57777a93da966759b1f4da6a2c57127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,143,3,212,245,119,119,169,61,169,102,117,155,31,77,166,162,197,113,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
