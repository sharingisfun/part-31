(Earlier releases had a Dolby Digital soundtrack). Because of the increased size of a DTS soundtrack over Dolby Digital, I have dropped the additional audio track with Rifftrax in the Rear Surround speakers.\n\n\n\nIf you like what Mike, Bill and Kevin are doing and you want them to be able to continue, please go toand click on &quot;Donate&quot; to donate whatever you think is appropriate. Rifftrax is a small, independent company of 10 people who do this for a living. Thanks.\n\nUMe2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:becfd591641e5a16feca54eea58a3754cc12fada","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Independence+Day+%281996%29+-+DualAudio.SurroundRifftrax.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"becfd591641e5a16feca54eea58a3754cc12fada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,207,213,145,100,30,90,22,254,202,84,238,165,138,55,84,204,18,250,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
