Dorf, James A. Svoboda\nWiley; 6 edition | English | June 20, 2003 | ISBN: 0471447951 | 671 Pages | PDF \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDescription : Praised for its highly accessible, real-world approach, the 6th Edition demonstrates how the analysis and design of electric circuits are inseparably intertwined with the ability of the engineer to design complex electronic, communication, computer, and control systems as well as consumer products. The book offers numerous design problems and MATLAB examples, and focuses on the circuits that we encounter everyday.
