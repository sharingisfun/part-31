As they try to escape to safety, they soon discover that there is a predator among them more deadly than the threat of drowning-vicious great white sharks lurking in the water, starved hungry for fresh meat. As the bloodthirsty sharks begin to pick the survivors off one by one, the group realizes that they must work together to find a way out without being eaten alive. \n\nGenre: Action, Horror, Thriller \nIMDB rating: 5.2 from 144 users \nDirected by: Kimble Rendall \nStarring: Phoebe Tonkin, Julian McMahon, Xavier Samuel \nRuntime: 91 min \n\nRelease Name: Bait.2012.BDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-AXED \nSize: 1.3 GB \nVideo: XViD | 720Ãƒâ€”400 | 1712 Kbps \nAudio: English | AC3 | 384 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9461eaf24813a6847feabf7b08a8445a8c83a307","amp;dn":"Bait.2012.BDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-AXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9461eaf24813a6847feabf7b08a8445a8c83a307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,97,234,242,72,19,166,132,127,234,191,123,8,168,68,90,140,131,163,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
