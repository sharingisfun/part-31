One Kind of Love\n\nLeona Naess's third album takes a turn away from the radio-ready veneer of 2001's I Tried to Rock You But You Only Roll in favor of the more austere arrangements of producer/multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Rufus Wainwright). Less immediately ear-grabbing than the previous disc, this self-titled record nonetheless sinks in deeply after a mere handful of plays. Naess's songs are closely observed and occasionally diary-like: in &quot;Star Signs,&quot; she recounts her reading a former lover's horoscopes, while &quot;Dues to Pay&quot; draws parallels between career and romantic hard knocks. Whether aiming for Tom Petty-style folk-rock or surrounded by a small group of string players, Naess's voice remains a truly affecting instrument, wistful and full-voiced at once. Hurt or not, you know, she'll get by.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a300b2ca36122c1873762a582f3dbbeabc7387","amp;dn":"Leona+Naess+-+Leona+Naess+%5B2003%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a300b2ca36122c1873762a582f3dbbeabc7387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,163,0,178,202,54,18,44,24,115,118,42,88,47,61,187,234,188,115,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
