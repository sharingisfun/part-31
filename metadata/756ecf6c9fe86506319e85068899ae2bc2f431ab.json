You will not find Inspector Japp, Inspector Lestrade or their ilk here. They are merely players in their respective universes. Yes, i know about the Inspector Lestrade novels, but I choose not to include any Inspector who has not also has a radio production of his/her adventures. \n\nThere are more than eighty Inspectors featured here, with productions from the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. \n\nThis torrent will take a while to seed and I have no objection to cherry-pickers selecting portions, as long as they SEED the portions that they select. \n\nMuch, although not all, of this work has been on Demonoid before in torrents that I posted four years ago (now dead). If you have any of those, feel free to seed them along with me. \n\nAnd, finally, thanks to all the original cappers and Usenet posters who provided source material for this omnibus.\n\nHere\\'s a list of the Inspectors whose efforts are captured here:\n\nInspector \\'Blackjack\\' Jackson (John Howlett)\nInspector Alleyn (Ngaio Marsh)\nInspector Anderson - No Defence Against Demons (Brian Lee)\nInspector Andrews - Something of the Night (Jenny McDade)\nInspector Ash - Across The Narrow Water (Tom Kelly)\nInspector Beck (Maj SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶wall &amp; Per WahlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶)\nInspector Boxer (and DC Doberman) (Alastair Jessiman)\nInspector Boyd (Nicholas Stark)\nInspector Brunner (Mike Walker)\nInspector Buller (T.H.
