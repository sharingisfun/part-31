But for more than four decades after its publication, the theory remained largely a curiosity for scientists; however accurate it seemed, EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mathematical codeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½represented by six interlocking equationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½was one of the most difficult to crack in all of science. That is, until a twenty-nine-year-old Cambridge graduate solved the great riddle in 1963. Roy KerrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solution emerged coincidentally with the discovery of black holes that same year and provided fertile testing groundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at long lastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for general relativity. Today, scientists routinely cite the Kerr solution, but even among specialists, few know the story of how Kerr cracked EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s code.\n\n\nFulvio Melia here offers an eyewitness account of the events leading up to KerrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great discovery. Cracking the Einstein Code vividly describes how luminaries such as Karl Schwarzschild, David Hilbert, and Emmy Noether set the stage for the Kerr solution; how Kerr came to make his breakthrough; and how scientists such as Roger Penrose, Kip Thorne, and Stephen Hawking used the accomplishment to refine and expand modern astronomy and physics. Today more than 300 million supermassive black holes are suspected of anchoring their host galaxies across the cosmos, and the Kerr solution is what astronomers and astrophysicists use to describe much of their behavior.\n\n\nBy unmasking the history behind the search for a real world solution to EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s field equations, Melia offers a first-hand account of an important but untold story. Sometimes dramatic, often exhilarating, but always attuned to the human element, Cracking the Einstein Code is ultimately a showcase of how important science gets done.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd816cafd6b7ba511e34d5468273c6531bb914dc","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Cracking+the+Einstein+Code+Relativity+and+the+Birth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd816cafd6b7ba511e34d5468273c6531bb914dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,129,108,175,214,183,186,81,30,52,213,70,130,115,198,83,27,185,20,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
