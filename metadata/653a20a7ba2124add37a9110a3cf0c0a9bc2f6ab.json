It's only in 128kbps so when it comes out on April 15th I'd suggest looking back on TPB and getting a new version. Regardless, if you want all the music in pretty decent quality, here you go. All tags should be set for iTunes even though their file names are awful. Have fun.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n01 Chariots of the Gods [ft.
