The lyrics were printed on the LP liner. The artwork was licensed from artist Chris Achilleos, although there seems to have been some alteration to the bodice; the breasts are not as exposed in the original. Whether this was done by Achilleos himself, or even with his approval, is currently unclear. Achilleos' website lists the original artwork as missing.\n\n[edit] British track listing\n&quot;Woman of The Night&quot; (Box, Lawton, Kerslake) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07 \n&quot;Falling in Love&quot; (Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 \n&quot;One More Night (Last Farewell)&quot; (Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 \n&quot;Put Your Lovin' on Me&quot; (Lawton) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n&quot;Come Back to Me&quot; (Kerslake, Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22 \n&quot;Whad'ya Say&quot; (Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n&quot;Save It&quot; (Bolder, Pete McDonald) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n&quot;Love or Nothing&quot; (Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \n&quot;I'm Alive&quot; (Lawton) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (Hensley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n \nBonus tracks on expanded de-luxe edition from 2004\n&quot;A Right To Live&quot; (out-take) \n&quot;Cheater&quot; (B-side) \n&quot;Gimme Love&quot; (B-side) \n&quot;Last Farewell&quot; (alternate version of 'One More Night') \n&quot;Street Lady&quot; (alternate version of 'Woman Of The Night') \n&quot;Struttin'&quot; (alternate version of 'Gimme Love') \n&quot;Falling In Love&quot; (Live) \n&quot;Woman Of The Night&quot; (Live) \n\nJohn Lawton - vocals \nMick Box ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars \nTrevor Bolder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar \nLee Kerslake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, back-up vocals \nKen Hensley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, synthesizer, guitars, back-up vocals \nChris Mercer (guest musician) played Saxophone.\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f03c4033b006c30e98f408fa0d70e30752cf9f","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep...Fallen+Angel%281978%29deluxe+edition%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f03c4033b006c30e98f408fa0d70e30752cf9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,240,60,64,51,176,6,195,14,152,244,8,250,13,112,227,7,82,207,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
