Her boyfriend\nof six years just left for a high-powered summer internship, though in\nreality heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been absent for much longer than that. This newfound\nfreedom wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a part of DarbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans, but as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come to discover,\nplans only exist on paper, not in reality.\n\nAnd guys like Torin Westbrook arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t supposed to exist in reality,\neither. But he does, with his disheveled curly hair, irresistible dimples,\nand endearingly quirky habit of reciting quotes from classic movies and\nancient thinkers. When Darby meets Torin as a fellow counselor at the\nsurvival camp she impulsively applies to, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain his main goal is\nto turn her world upside-down.\n\nBut DarbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure she can adapt to TorinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ways of viewing his past\nand the tragedies he's faced. Because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had her own share of\nheartache, too, and as much as she wants to believe that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all been\nfor a purpose, her grief hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allowed her to get to that point. Yet the\nmore Darby is around Torin, the more she craves the freedom to break\nout of her carefully constructed routine and mindset and fall into\nsomething new.\n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not sure that she should be falling for Torin along the way.\n\n(The Rules of Regret is a non-explicit, new adult romance.)\n\n\n\nThe Rules of Regret\nBy: Squires, Megan\nPages: EPUB 487 - PDF 1311\nLanguage: EN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2114503d99fd329f6d47437f8d9c0a0f4f40c20","amp;dn":"The+Rules+of+Regret+-+Squires%2C+Megan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2114503d99fd329f6d47437f8d9c0a0f4f40c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,17,69,3,217,159,211,41,246,212,116,55,248,217,192,160,244,244,12,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
