At Reed's funeral, his widow Violet encourages her brother-in-law, Grahame Chandler, to mentor her son, Cal, through the ranks of political office, to follow in the footsteps of his father. Violet and Grahame shepherd Cal through successful campaigns for the City Council and Governorship, but Cal gets mixed up with local mob boss Anthony Gliardi and begins an affair with a club singer, Tina. Alcohol and drugs take their strain on Cal. Eventually, the mob turns on Cal, and he and Tina are brutally gunned down.\n\nProduction:\nThe Fix was originally developed in association with Cameron Mackintosh under the working title Cal: A Musical Tale of Relative Insanity.
