It was very successful with four singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts, while the album reached No. 6 on the US Billboard 200 album chart. The album has been certified by RIAA 2x platinum and by BPI silver.\n\n\n A slick, carefully crafted follow-up to his debut, Rebel Yell was Billy Idol's catchiest, most consistent fusion of synth-driven new wave pop and hard rock guitar pyrotechnics (courtesy of Steve Stevens). The eerie ballad &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; gave Idol his first U.S. Top Ten hit, while &quot;Flesh for Fantasy&quot; and the title track became MTV staples. Like much of Idol's solo output, it's all calculated for maximum appeal, but Rebel Yell also works too well not to be an infectiously guilty pleasure.
