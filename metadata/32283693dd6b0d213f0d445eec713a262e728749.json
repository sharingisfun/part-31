The Blue Team won the challenge, despite a risky decision to cook a fish entrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, knowing Gordon's mother doesn't like fish.\n\nPressure Test Elimination 4 - The Red Team were given 30 minutes to create the perfect Eggs Benedict. Ben and Suzy were the only two to cook competent dishes, with only minor flaws. After they were declared safe, Giuseppe, Derrick and Alejandra were left. Alejandra failed to impress with her overcooked eggs &quot;like golfballs&quot; and botched hollandaise sauce, but was the third to be declared safe. The decision was between Giuseppe's messy dish with undercooked eggs and Derrick's with a lack of sauce. Ultimately, the judges decided that serving them raw eggs was the biggest mistake and Giuseppe was eliminated.\n\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday July 19, 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32283693dd6b0d213f0d445eec713a262e728749","amp;dn":"MasterChef.US.S02E12.HDTV.XviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32283693dd6b0d213f0d445eec713a262e728749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,40,54,147,221,107,13,33,63,13,68,94,236,113,58,38,46,114,135,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
