About 4 kills are missing, language and nudity. Also it is a Full Screen presentation in mono sound. In some ways this is a great cut to any real fan... in other ways this cut is at times a bit poorly edited. For instance when the hospital guard Mr. Garrett is out checking the phone problem... the cat and mouse between him and Myers is just awful!!! Obvious scenes from other parts of the movie are weaved in, in some attempt to fool our eyes. You'll see this towards the end too when Jimmy falls. But you be the judge... enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62499fa1def3837977eb66b97933df140942f906","amp;dn":"Halloween+II+1981+%28TV+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62499fa1def3837977eb66b97933df140942f906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,73,159,161,222,243,131,121,119,235,102,185,121,51,223,20,9,66,249,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
