The Story of Stuff examines how economic policies of the post-World War II era ushered in notions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œplanned obsolescenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œperceived obsolescenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how these notions are still driving much of the U.S. and global economies today. LeonardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inspiration for the film began as a personal musing over the question, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere does all the stuff we buy come from, and where does it go when we throw it out?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ She traveled the world in pursuit of the answer to this seemingly innocent question, and what she found along the way were some very guilty participants and their unfortunate victims.\n\nWritten by Leonard, the film was produced by Free Range Studios, the makers of other highly popular web-based films such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MeatrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrocery Store Wars.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Funding for the project came from The Funders Workgroup for Sustainable Production and Consumption and Tides Foundation.\n\nAll contents of this torrent are from thestoryofstuff.org, and can be freely redistributed under the Creative Commons license.
