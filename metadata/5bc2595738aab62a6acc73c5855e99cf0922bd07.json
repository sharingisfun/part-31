It will let you open files from inside archives, and lets you preview them using Quick Look.\n\nIt is based on The Unarchiver, which means it can handle a large number of different archive formats: It can handle common formats like Zip, RAR, 7-zip, Tar, Gzip and Bzip2, as well as older formats like StuffIt, DiskDoubler, LZH, ARJ and ARC. It can also handle other kinds of formats, like CD and DVD images such as ISO, BIN, MDF, NRG and CDI, many Windows self-extracting EXE files, and can even extract media from Flash SWF files. It will also handle different filename encodings gracefully.\n\nFor the curious, it will also show you a lot of information about the archives and their contents.\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.2\n\n* Added option for opening extracted files in the Finder.\n* Added Services for opening and extracting archives.\n* Added option for closing browser windows after extraction.\n* Added a workaround for a Mac OS X sandbox bug that was causing extracted apps to not launch properly.\n* Fixed extraction of partial RAR files.\n* Fixed spurious warnings about resource forks for some Zip files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc2595738aab62a6acc73c5855e99cf0922bd07","amp;dn":"The+Archive+Browser+1.2+Cracked+from+Mac+App+Store","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc2595738aab62a6acc73c5855e99cf0922bd07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,194,89,87,56,170,182,42,106,204,115,197,133,94,153,207,9,34,189,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
