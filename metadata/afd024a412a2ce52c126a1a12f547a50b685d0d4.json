Not only can you play classic Tetris, but it also includes new game pieces that will make it even more challenging. Color Tetris is also included for another style of Tetris when you want something different.\n\n   * &quot;Incredibly fun game! I can&amp;#039;t stop playing it! I love the effects - especially when you complete a line, the line crumbles apart. I can hum along with the songs, and I love the new interesting shapes!&quot; - Jenny Miller, Tetris 4000 player\n\nIn the classic Tetris game mode, there are several variants that make the game interesting but don&amp;#039;t detract from the basic premise. If you get in trouble with your stack, press F8 and a large rubber bomb will knock out all the unneccessary pieces. Also, there are new random blocks that fall that will make your game very challenging. Occassionally a bomb will also drop to help clear away some of the clutter.
