Guitarist Benjamin Curtis, Drummer Josh Garza, and Brandon Curtis (vocals, bass, keys) formed the Secret Machines in the midst of summer of 2000, in Dallas, TX. The trio swiftly managed to create its own sounding marks, mostly due to a common musical and band experience.Before forming the Machines, the Curtis brothers played with the punk rock squad Ufofu; in addition, BrandonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a regular headliner of the Dallas underground music scene, namely through his active participation in projects such as captain audio alongside Garza. After several months of rehearsals and recording sessions in Chicago with engineer Brian Deck, the Machines offered their debut disc, the EP September 000, in March of 2002. After touring throughout much of 2002, the band returned to their adopted hometown of New York City and began recording the debut full-length for Reprise with producer Jeff Blenkinsopp. The album Now Here is Nowhere was released in May of 2004.\nThis was then followed up by their second full length album Ten Silver Drops, released in April 2006 to mixed critical responses.\nWhile working on their third album, Benjamin left the band to continue his work with School of Seven Bells, a new project with members of the disbanded On!Air!Library!. Josh and Brandon are continuing working on the album, wich is to be released soon..\n\nMy other torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&lt;/a&gt;\t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52203bf452944a22f1880f4978986a11277a823","amp;dn":"secret+machines+-+2006+ten+silver+drops","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52203bf452944a22f1880f4978986a11277a823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,34,3,191,69,41,68,162,47,24,128,244,151,137,134,161,18,119,168,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
