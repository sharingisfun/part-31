It covers the collapse of the former Yugoslavia. It is notable in its combination of never-before-seen archive footage interspersed with interviews of most of the main players in the conflict, including Slobodan MiloÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡eviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡, then President of Serbia. This format, pioneered by the programme's production company, Brian Lapping Associates, was very influential and the company produced many others in similar style.\n\nThe six parts were entitled:\n\n   1. Enter Nationalism\n   2. The Road to War\n   3. Wars of Independence\n   4. The Gates of Hell\n   5. A Safe Area\n   6. Pax Americana\n\nThe programme has been re-edited in three parts:\n\n   1. Enter MiloÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡eviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡\n   2. The Croats Strike Back\n   3. The Struggle for Bosnia\n\nAnd was later broadcast as a feature-length single documentary.\n\nAll the papers relating to the documentary series, including full transcripts of the many valuable interviews conducted with participants, are lodged at the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College, University of London. The catalogue can be examined here\n\nDuring the trial of MiloÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡eviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ before the ICTY Judge Bonomy called the nature of the much of the commentary &quot;tendentious&quot;. This was because there were instances in which an interview in the Serbian language was subtitled incorrectly and often in a misleading manner (for example, the subtitling translated an interviewee saying that &quot;Milosevic always won the elections on a nationalistic platform and nothing else&quot;, rather than &quot;... on a national platform... &quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc82289b3c58ed0d5cc3b5450dac39112baa751f","amp;dn":"The+Death+of+Yugoslavia+full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc82289b3c58ed0d5cc3b5450dac39112baa751f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,130,40,155,60,88,237,13,92,195,181,69,13,172,57,17,43,170,117,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
