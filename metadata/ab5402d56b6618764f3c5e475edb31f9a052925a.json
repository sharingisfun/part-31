Integrating an interdisciplinary set of artistic practices and artificial intelligence technologies, we have completed a five year collaboration to engineer a novel architecture for supporting emotional, interactive character behavior and drama-managed plot. Within this architecture we have built a dramatically interesting, real-time 3D virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, in which the player experiences a story from a first-person perspective. FaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade was publicly released as a freeware download / cd-rom in July 2005.\n\nYou, the player, using your own name and gender, play the character of a longtime friend of Grace and Trip, an attractive and materially successful couple in their early thirties. During an evening get-together at their apartment that quickly turns ugly, you become entangled in the high-conflict dissolution of Grace and TripÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s marriage. No one is safe as the accusations fly, sides are taken and irreversible decisions are forced to be made. By the end of this intense one-act play you will have changed the course of Grace and TripÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ motivating you to re-play the drama to find out how your interaction could make things turn out differently the next time.\n\n\n\n\nFor Windows: requires 1.6GHz Pentium 4  or higher\nWindows XP, 2000 or ME\n1.0GB free disk space, 256MB memory\nFaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade will not run properly on Windows computers slower than 1.6GHz Pentium 4\n\n\n\nPlease Seed!
