Written by Frances Hodgson Burnett; Full cast dramatisation starring Beryl Reid, Harriet Walter and Robin Bailey; Dramatised by Judy Allen; Produced by John Taylor.\n\nWhen spoilt young orphan Mary Lennox is brought back from India to live in her uncle's house on the Yorkshire Moors, she finds the blunt ways of the staff at Misselthwaite Manor an unpleasant shock. Bored and miserable, it seems as though life in England will be awful. But Misselthwaite has hidden delights and, when Mary begins to discover them, nothing is the same again. First, there is the secret garden - and with it comes a boy who knows all the wonders of the country. He can even talk to the birds! Then, as the old house gives up its biggest secret, Mary forms a magical friendship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67411c9d9b245814ada399798dbd793198ac2ea4","amp;dn":"Frances+Hodgson+Burnett+-+The+Secret+Garden+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67411c9d9b245814ada399798dbd793198ac2ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,65,28,157,155,36,88,20,173,163,153,121,141,189,121,49,152,172,46,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
