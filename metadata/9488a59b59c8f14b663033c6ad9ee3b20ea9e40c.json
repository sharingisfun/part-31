As the battle reaches a fever pitch you see the faces of your men - young soldiers looking older than their years under the stress of battle. You know the stories behind those faces, their strengths, and their weaknesses. The success of this assault depends on your leadership, strategy and the combined efforts of all your men working together as one. Putting yourself in harms way you create a diversion by opening fire from your vantage point. Your men seize the opportunity and move up to overtake the enemy - these are the steps to victory-this is what it means to be a squad leader! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/avalon-hills-squad-leader/pc-14776&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/avalon-hills-squad-leader/pc-14776&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9488a59b59c8f14b663033c6ad9ee3b20ea9e40c","amp;dn":"Squad+Leader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9488a59b59c8f14b663033c6ad9ee3b20ea9e40c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,136,165,155,89,200,241,75,102,48,51,198,173,158,227,178,14,169,228,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
