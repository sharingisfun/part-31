With school behind him and a summer job at a brick works, Tom had his whole life before him. Years later, alone in a rented flat in Edinburgh and lost in memories, Tom recalls the intellectual and sexual awakening of his youth. In looking back, Tom discovers that only by understanding where he comes from can he make sense of his life as it is now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2304306246298c4d6e95fdb3434d85fa2abdf85","amp;dn":"The+Kiln+-+William+McIlvanney.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2304306246298c4d6e95fdb3434d85fa2abdf85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,48,67,6,36,98,152,196,214,233,95,219,52,52,216,95,162,171,223,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
