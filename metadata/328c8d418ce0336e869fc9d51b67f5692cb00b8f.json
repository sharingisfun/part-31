Not to the Lial team! Marge Lial, John Hornsby, and Terry McGinnis write their textbooks and accompanying resources with one goal in mind: giving students all the tools they need to achieve success.\n\n \n\nWith this revision, the Lial team has further refined the presentation and exercises throughout the text. They offer several exciting new resources for students that will provide extra help when needed, regardless of the learning environment (classroom, lab, hybrid, online, etc)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“new study skills activities in the text, an expanded video program available in MyMathLab and on the Video Resources on DVD, and more!\nFrom the Back Cover\nConsistent with its approach, interesting applications featuring real world data in the form of ordered pairs, tables, bar and line graphs, and equations have been incorporated throughout the book.The book includes in-depth coverage of &quot;true&quot; college algebra topics. New to this edition and consistent with current teaching practices is the early introduction of graphing lines in a rectangular coordinate system and functions in Chapter 3. This organization provides readers/students with increased exposure to basic graphing and function concepts, an integral part of later mathematics courses, as they study polynomial, rational, and radical expressions in Chapters 4-6. Chapters 8-10 provide comprehensive coverage of additional graphing and function topics. --This text refers to an alternate Hardcover edition.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 936 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 7 edition (January 29, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321715403\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321715401\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328c8d418ce0336e869fc9d51b67f5692cb00b8f","amp;dn":"Algebra+for+College+Students+%2C7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328c8d418ce0336e869fc9d51b67f5692cb00b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,140,141,65,140,224,51,110,134,159,201,213,27,103,245,105,44,176,11,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
