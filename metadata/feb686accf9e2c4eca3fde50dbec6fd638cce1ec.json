In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 6 : The Mosquito Raiders\n\nOne of the most specialised roles of De Havilland's &quot;Wooden Wonder&quot;, the ultra-fast Mosquito fighter-bomber, was pinpoint raids in support of the Resistance movements in Nazi-occupied Europe. And one of the most spectacular examples was the attack on Amiens prison before D-Day which freed a large numbers of key Resistance leaders who were facing imminent execution.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb686accf9e2c4eca3fde50dbec6fd638cce1ec","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.06of26.The.Mosquito.Raiders.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb686accf9e2c4eca3fde50dbec6fd638cce1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,182,134,172,207,158,44,78,202,63,222,80,219,236,111,214,56,204,225,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
