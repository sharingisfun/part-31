But who knew that you could make fertilizer from soaking weeds in water? The editors have collected ideas from organic gardeners all over the country that will help even experienced gardeners improve their soil, fertilize their plants, reduce weeds and pests, and even concoct a soothing hand cream to use when the work is done. Grouped thematically by chapter, these formulas employ either natural ingredients or simple chemicals such as Epsom salts, and most are easy to make and use. The word formula is used in its broadest sense, as there are suggestions for attracting butterflies and for making a wildflower meadow as well as creating fertilizer from Swiss chard or herbal candles. A source list for products and services ends the book. This will be a great source for crafters as well as for creative garden experimenters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d26668f50f2920e298bda68d225f4d6c6183d6c","amp;dn":"Great+Garden+Formulas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d26668f50f2920e298bda68d225f4d6c6183d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,38,102,143,80,242,146,14,41,139,218,104,210,37,244,214,198,24,61,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
