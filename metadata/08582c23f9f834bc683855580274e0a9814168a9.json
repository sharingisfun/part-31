They sounded muffled or somehow distorted. so, I sacked up, purchased a copy of my very own and ripped it to the best of my ability.\n\nThe book is chapterized so feel free to dl just one and see if it's something you would be interested in (for using in your own digital backup of course).\n\nI'll keep this seeded for at minimum a few weeks since I have nothing else to do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08582c23f9f834bc683855580274e0a9814168a9","amp;dn":"The+Dresden+Files%3A+Death+Masks+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08582c23f9f834bc683855580274e0a9814168a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,88,44,35,249,248,52,188,104,56,85,88,2,116,224,169,129,65,104,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
