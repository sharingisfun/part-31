But in fact that it was the most-watched dramatic special in the history of television,and its considerable impact on its viewers was outstanding. The overall success of ROOTS was unprecedented. Approxiamately over 100 million viewers saw the concluding installment and it must be considered an event of considerable magnitude when nearly half of the entire population of the United States can be assembled in front of its television sets to watch a single dramatic presentation. No one,not even ABC,was prepared for anything this big. In fact,one of the reasons given for scheduling ROOTS on eight consecutive nights was that if it were a flop it would be over with quickly. But it wasn&amp;#039;t. It became a tidalwave of a hit. And America was watching.\n\n\n\n\n\nI&amp;#039;ll be seeding this episode tomorrow .\n\n\nIf you are currently downloading the previous torrent&amp;#039;s I upped , you can still  use this torrent as the film files are the same .  \n\nPlease, enjoy .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb5b92dbfecb6a8f82719c09f55d844507364df","amp;dn":"Roots+Part+2+of+6++-+for+Black+History+Month+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb5b92dbfecb6a8f82719c09f55d844507364df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,181,185,45,191,236,182,168,248,39,25,192,159,85,216,68,80,115,100,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
