Unfortunately, her gift from New OrleansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ voodoo queen just keeps on giving - leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit.\n\nCenturies ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity - forever. But how do you kill a killer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already long dead?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfb0e5de14500466bee689adceac0b80a3e8aea","amp;dn":"One+Grave+at+a+Time+-+Jeaniene+Frost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfb0e5de14500466bee689adceac0b80a3e8aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,251,14,93,225,69,0,70,107,238,104,154,220,234,192,184,10,62,138,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
