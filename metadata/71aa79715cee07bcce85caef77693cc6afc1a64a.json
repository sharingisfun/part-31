It has the recognisable Ithaca and Agincourt sound, mostly with different lead vocals (mainly by Peter Howell), but with all the same elements and participants.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71aa79715cee07bcce85caef77693cc6afc1a64a","amp;dn":"Friends+%28Ithaca%29+-+Fragile+%281972%29+%28UK+folk%29+%28mp3%2C+128+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71aa79715cee07bcce85caef77693cc6afc1a64a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,170,121,113,92,238,7,188,206,133,202,239,119,105,60,198,175,193,166,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
