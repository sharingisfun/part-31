Mark Timmons maintains that all versions of descriptivism in ethics, particularly certain accounts of moral realism, fail. He argues instead that a correct metaethical theory should embrace some version of non-descriptivism. Timmons defends what he calls &quot;assertoric non-descriptivism&quot; which, unlike traditional non-descriptivist views, holds that moral sentences are typically used to make genuine assertions. In defending this view, he exploits contextual semantics, providing him with the semantic flexibility to develop an irrealist account of moral discourse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897b2a0d6211348d86e09ad0e586e6e710049407","amp;dn":"Morality+without+Foundations%3A+A+Defense+of+Ethical+Contextualism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897b2a0d6211348d86e09ad0e586e6e710049407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,123,42,13,98,17,52,141,134,224,154,208,229,134,230,231,16,4,148,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
