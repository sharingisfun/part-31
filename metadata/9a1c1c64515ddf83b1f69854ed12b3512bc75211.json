First, a complete and uninterrupted video shows the skill being performed with explanations as to &quot;why&quot; the skill is important. Next, the exact same video is replayed, with the addition of key pauses, where the instructors use an &quot;on-screen grease pencil&quot; and explain &quot;how&quot; we do a skill including subtitles and other instructions. It's an excellent way to both visualize the skill and hear the key points before you take your class. Then during the class the instructor will reference these skills videos, and after class you can review each skill and compare and contrast your team's performance. These DVD's are easy to use and intelligently laid out to allow you to see only the skills you want, or all of them in sequence.\n\nBonus skills are added which involve a greater mastery of the foundational technical skills - they are included as a useful &quot;signpost&quot; to where you may want to take your Technical Diving.\n\nAdditional bonus tracks include:\n\n-Valve Failures\n-Tie a primary line\n-Single bottle passing \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.createspace.com/Store/ShowEStore.jsp?id=209712&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.createspace.com/Store/ShowEStore.jsp?id=209712&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1c1c64515ddf83b1f69854ed12b3512bc75211","amp;dn":"Intro+to+Technical+Diving","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1c1c64515ddf83b1f69854ed12b3512bc75211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,28,28,100,81,93,223,131,177,246,152,84,237,18,179,81,43,199,82,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
