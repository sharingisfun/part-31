This book compiles and synthesizes that information in a single source, thus enabling those in one discipline to become familiar with the concepts and applications in other disciplines of food science.\r\n\r\nProvides latest information on acrylamide in various foods (bakery products, fried potato products, coffee, battered products, water, table olives, etc.)\r\nExplores acrylamide in the food chain in the context of harm, such as acrylamide and cancer, neuropathology of acrylamide, maternal acrylamide and effects on offspring and its toxic effects in tissues\r\nTouches on a variety of subjects, including acrylamide, high heated foods, dietary acrylamide, acrylamide formation, N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)-cysteine (AAMA), acrylamide removal, L-asparaginase, and acrylamide determination\r\nPresents recent analytical methodologies for acrylamide determination, including liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a997f93592b975c33d4145ec76074366a6d40a","amp;dn":"Acrylamide+in+Food+-+Analysis%2C+Content+and+Potential+Health+Effe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a997f93592b975c33d4145ec76074366a6d40a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,169,151,249,53,146,185,117,195,61,65,69,236,118,7,67,102,166,212,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
