Why do so many people go along with the crowd and fail to stand up for what they truly believe? Partly because they are too easily swayed by other people's opinions and partly because they don't know when to have confidence in their own.\n\nEpisode 2: Epicurus on Happiness In the second of this six part series, British philosopher Alain De Botton discusses the personal implications of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270BCE) who was no epicurean glutton or wanton consumerist, but an advocate of &quot;friends, freedom and thought&quot; as the path to happiness.\n\nEpisode 3: Seneca on Anger Roman philosopher Lucious Annaeus Seneca (4BCE-65CE), the most famous and popular philosopher of his day, took the subject of anger seriously enough to dedicate a whole book to the subject. Seneca refused to see anger as an irrational outburst over which we have no control. Instead he saw it as a philosophical problem and amenable to treatment by philosophical argument. He thought anger arose from certain rationally held ideas about the world, and the problem with these ideas is that they are far too optimistic. Certain things are a predictable feature of life, and to get angry about them is to have unrealistic expectations.\n\nEpisode 4: Montaigne on Self-Esteem This episode looks at the problem of self-esteem from the perspective of Michel de Montaigne (16th Century), the French philosopher who singled out three main reasons for feeling bad about oneself - sexual inadequacy, failure to live up to social norms, and intellectual inferiority - and then offered practical solutions for overcoming them.\n\nEpisode 5: Schopenhauer on Love Alain De Botton surveys the 19th Century German thinker Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) who believed that love was the most important thing in life because of its powerful impulse towards 'the will-to-life'.\n\nEpisode 6: Nietzsche on Hardship British philosopher Alain De Botton explores Friedrich Nietzsche's (1844-1900) dictum that any worthwhile achievements in life come from the experience of overcoming hardship. For him, any existence that is too comfortable is worthless, as are the twin refugees of drink or religion.\n\nThis DVD series is truly a masterpiece of philosophy that links a variety of eras in order to help us understand and ensure happiness in our lives. Once again Alain De Botton takes us on a journey of the different thoughts on happiness from around the world that actually helps us understand our own views. Highly compelling!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc7e108f2e3e58048d73bb9b72d9281e3827150","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+Hapiness+%28eng+audio%2B+PT+sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc7e108f2e3e58048d73bb9b72d9281e3827150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,199,225,8,242,227,229,128,72,215,59,185,183,45,146,129,227,130,113,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
