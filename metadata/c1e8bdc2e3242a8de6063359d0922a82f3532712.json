The noble female collie befriends a young mute boy (Michael-James Wixted), who runs away with Lassie. As a result of the warm boy-and-dog relationship, the lad breaks his silence (Dr. Lassie, speech therapist: The mind boggles...) In the course of the story, Lassie also has a litter of pups--a neat trick, considering that &quot;she&quot; was portrayed by a male dog.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.moviekids.org/code/movie_page.php?item=1405&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.moviekids.org/code/movie_page.php?item=1405&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: the DVD quality on these old Lassie films is average but quite watchable\n\nXVID, 512x368, Qf=0.188","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e8bdc2e3242a8de6063359d0922a82f3532712","amp;dn":"Lassie+-+The+Miracle+%281970%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e8bdc2e3242a8de6063359d0922a82f3532712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,232,189,194,227,36,42,141,230,6,51,89,208,146,42,130,243,83,39,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
