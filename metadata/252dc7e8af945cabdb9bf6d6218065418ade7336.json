I add more movies every week to my collection. I will continue to learn and post movies, and seed them for a little while, then its up to others to take over. But one thing im VERY sick of, is getting fake movies from here, and other places. Ill say it right now, if people dont post more about what the movie is, and people keep posting fake ass, virus and trojan riddled &quot;movies&quot;, then I quit, and i wont add anymore GENUINE HQ MP4/H264/IPAD/IPOD rips. So far ive checked out about 15 movies, and I think only 1 was genuine, and its poor quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252dc7e8af945cabdb9bf6d6218065418ade7336","amp;dn":"Gullivers+Travels+-+Jack+Black+%28H264%29+%28IPAD%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252dc7e8af945cabdb9bf6d6218065418ade7336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,45,199,232,175,148,92,171,219,155,246,214,33,128,101,65,138,222,115,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
