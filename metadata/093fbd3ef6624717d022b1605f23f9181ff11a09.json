A widely published writer, author, and interviewer, and the Executive Director of Feminist.com, Schnall began looking at the issues from various angles and perspectives.\n\nWhat Will It Take to Make A Woman President? features interviews with politicians, public officials, thought leaders, writers, artists, and activists in an attempt to discover the obstacles that have held women back and what needs to change in order to elect a woman into the White House.\n\nWith insights and personal anecdotes from Sheryl Sandberg, Maya Angelou, Gloria Steinem, Nancy Pelosi, Nicholas Kristof, Melissa Etheridge, and many more, this book addresses timely, provocative issues involving women, politics, and power. With a broader goal of encouraging women and girls to be leaders, Schnall and her interviewees explore the changing paradigms occurring in politics and in our culture with the hope of moving toward meaningful and effective solutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€and a world where a woman can be president.\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Politics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093fbd3ef6624717d022b1605f23f9181ff11a09","amp;dn":"What+Will+It+Take+to+Make+A+Woman+President__+Conversations+Abou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093fbd3ef6624717d022b1605f23f9181ff11a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,63,189,62,246,98,71,23,208,34,177,96,95,35,249,24,31,241,26,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
