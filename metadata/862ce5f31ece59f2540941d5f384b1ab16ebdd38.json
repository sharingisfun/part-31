It's a live show with questions at the end.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nJohn F. Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nLEGAL MESS\n\nI explain why our legal system is a mess. We have a live audience.\n\nWRONGFUL CONVICTIONS: Now that DNA evidence is more available, we know that lots of people are locked up for things they didn't do. I talk to an audience member who served 16 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nEYEWITNESS EXAM: Are eyewitness reports actually reliable? Probably not. I secretly have an intern steal something from my desk. Will the audience properly identify the &quot;thief?&quot;\n\nSTUPID LAWS: One reason our legal system is such a mess is because politicians don't think they're doing their job unless they're passing more laws! Philadelphia requires bloggers to purchase a $400 license. Milwaukee says you need a license to go out of business.\n\nUBER TAKEDOWN: Because ridesharing services like Uber are better, they are destroying the taxi monopoly. That makes the taxi business and their friends in government angry.\n\nWACKY WARNING LABELS: Companies are so afraid of lawsuits they routinely include absurd labels: a bag of frozen catfish pieces warns: &quot;Contains fish.&quot; A toy that looks like the Easter Bunny warns: &quot;This toy is in no way intended to represent living people.&quot; It doesn't protect them. It doesn't protect us, either. The Stossel audience picks the $1000 winner of the Wacky Warning Label Contest.\n\nMY TAKE: Lawyers can help you make things right! But lawyers rarely mention the nasty unintended side-effects of their lawsuits: we all pay more for everything, we all drown in stupid law, and we're deprived of good things.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.07.24.Legal.Mess.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.159\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862ce5f31ece59f2540941d5f384b1ab16ebdd38","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.07.24.Legal.Mess.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862ce5f31ece59f2540941d5f384b1ab16ebdd38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,44,229,243,30,206,89,242,84,9,65,213,243,132,177,171,22,235,221,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
