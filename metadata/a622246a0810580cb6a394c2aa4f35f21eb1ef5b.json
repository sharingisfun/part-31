A true hybrid of storytelling, half the episode is the harrowing, blow-by-blow tale of one woman's struggle for survival against the ultimate evil; the other half is the story of a killer on the loose and the detectives who doggedly work to track him down and stop his reign of terror. Artfully woven together, the two stories finally merge into one in the final act","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a622246a0810580cb6a394c2aa4f35f21eb1ef5b","amp;dn":"I+Escaped+My+Killer+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a622246a0810580cb6a394c2aa4f35f21eb1ef5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,34,36,106,8,16,88,12,182,163,148,194,170,79,53,242,30,177,239,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
