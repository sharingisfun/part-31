Different Stripe offers a lengthy retrospective of her impressive musical career, and although it has been released by Philo, it contains several selections from her work with Capitol. Wheeler is an introspective songwriter with a contemporary folk sensibility.\n\nThis is mostly a compilation album. There are two previously unrecorded songs on this album: Gandhi/Buddha and Walk Around Downtown. The others are from her previous albums.\n\nThis isn't really a &quot;Best Of&quot; album. It was put together by Tony Gottlieb, Cheryl's manager. It is essentially Tony's favorite ballads.\n\nThe purpose of this album is to introduce Cheryl to a wider audience. An infomercial has been put together by mixing Cheryl's video What Do I Care? I Don't Have Any Kids Construction Company with offers for this album. In addition, the CD has some software such that you can access www.musicnotes.com and download actual sheet music from Cheryl.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:098614a237df69f0c90220e870b262e6985ee99a","amp;dn":"Cheryl+Wheeler+-+Different+Stripe++%282003%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"098614a237df69f0c90220e870b262e6985ee99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,134,20,162,55,223,105,240,201,2,32,232,112,178,98,230,152,94,233,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
