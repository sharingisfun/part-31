Backed by a fine Finnish rhythm section, Sandoval and the great trumpeter are both in good spirits playing five of Gillespie's originals including &quot;Wheatleigh Hall&quot; and &quot;And Then She Stopped.&quot; Considering that it would be another decade before Sandoval was able to defect from Cuba (and finally play the music he wanted), this recording is of great historic value. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Wheatleigh Hall\n02 - First Chance\n03 - And Then She Stopped\n04 - Rimsky\n05 - Dizzy The Duck\n\nEnjoy and share!
