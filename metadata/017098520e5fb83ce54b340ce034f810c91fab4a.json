In just one or two steps, you can copy DVDs to DVDR/PSP and even iPod. For such a powerful package, it only requires 1.3MB of your harddrive, so it's not bulky like similar packages.\n\nDVD protection is advancing at an ever increasing rate but unfortunately for the manufacturers, so are the ripping programs. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever had problems copying one of your favorite DVDs then DVDFab could be what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been looking for. It has proved popular a hit with thousands of Softonic users so far and there seems little prospect of its popularity waning.\n\nThe DVDFab conversion process couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be easier. There are 5 DVD to DVD copy modes available - Full Disc, Main Movie, Split, Customize and Clone. In Full Disc mode, all movies, menus and trailers are copied to a DVD in one click. In Main Movie mode, only the movie is copied with your specified audio. In Split mode, you can copy a DVD-9 onto two DVD-5 discs but also preserve the original menus on both discs. According to the DVDFab developers, this rare feature is ideal for TV series on DVD.\n\nDVDFab's handy Customize mode allows you to personalize your DVDs by recording such things as only your favorite scenes, removing adverts or selecting only certain audio tracks. Finally, Clone allows you to make exact 1:1 bit-to-bit copies or even copy games disks such as PS2 DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. There is also a DVD to Mobile option so you can watch your favorite films on your iPod or other handheld device. Formats available on DVDFab include MPEG-4, DivX, XVID and Mp4.\n\nDVDFab is a tough cookie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even disks that refuse to be copied with other programs can usually be cracked. The customize option allows you to get rid of files that stand in your way and just rip the actual movie. It can also help in recovering scratched or dirty disks that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play properly in your DVD player anymore. Ripping speed is remarkably fast with DVDFab - depending on the size of disk, you can record a new one in less than 10 minutes, although the average time is around 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the minor drawbacks to DVDFab is that the heavy processing power needed to rip a disk often results in crashes. This will be less of a problem on more powerful machines but on machines with old processors, using DVDFab may become impractical. Many user forums are however full of praise for DVDFab claiming that it can rip more disks and, what's more, faster than comparable products such as DVD Shrink or ShrinkTo5.\n\nEverybody will appreciate the simplicity and power of DVDFab, a rip-roaring DVD ripper..\n\n\nDVDFab What's New\n\nJuly 26, 2013\nDVDFab 9.0.5.5 Updated!\n\nNew: Added support for new Java protections.\nNew: Added support for a new copy protection as found on &quot;Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor&quot;.\nNew: Added support for multiple audio track output for m2ts profiles.\nNew: Added support customize image of menu for Blu-ray and DVD Creator.\nNew: Added support Live Update and show the update log.\nNew: Some minor changes and improvements.\nFix: A freeze problem when opening source and then click cancel button in certain cases.\nFix: A problem that missing task process number when burning and creating, such as: Task 1/2.\nFix: Some localization issues for JA-JP.\nFix: A crash problem when opening DVD source in certain cases.\nFix: A crash problem when opening Blu-ray source after a DVD source was opened in certain cases.\nFix: A problem thatcannot recognize the BD-ROM drive in Windows 8 in certain cases.\nFix: A problem that cannot enable CUDA and DXVA accelerations in certain cases.\nFix: A crash problem when deleting the profile which was downloaded from Profile Editor Official website.\nFix: A crash problem after navigating from Burn mode to Customize mode.\nFix: Some minor changes and improvements.\nFix: Localization problems.\nFix: A problem that should not display the disc in source list after it was ejected.\nFix: A pixilated problem when playing back the copied Blu-ray 3D disc with Blu-ray 3D Stand-alone player, such as: Wreck_It_Ralph_3D.\nFix: A problem that cannot open physics Blu-ray disc in certain cases, such as: Fantastic4_2.\nFix: A freeze problem when copying Blu-ray with both Lightning-Recoding and &quot;Convert DTS/LPCM to AC3&quot; option are enabled.\nFix: A freeze problem when copying Blu-ray 3D disc to Blu-ray SBS 3D in certain cases, such as: Cars_2_3D and Puss_in_Boots_3D.\nFix: A problem that failed to rip Blu-ray disc to Galaxy Note II in certain cases.\nFix: A problem that cannot eject disc after burned in certain cases.\nFix: A crash problem when ripping DVD to vob.passthrough and the option &quot;Display the forced subtitle only&quot; is enabled.\nFix: A freeze problem when ripping Blu-ray to mkv.h264.audiocopy in certain cases, such as: Rio.\nFix: A problem that failed to rip Blu-ray disc to avi.h264.audiocopy, such as: &quot;Cars_USA.iso&quot;.\nFix: A problem that &quot;Display the forced subtitle only&quot; option does not work for in certain cases.\nFix: A work 1 failed error problem when ripping DVD disc to WMV AC3/1 audio track.\nFix: A crash problem when ripping Blu-ray disc in certain cases, such as: Mariah_Carey_The_Adventures_of_Mimi.\nFix: A crash problem when converting or creating with mkv files in certain cases.\nFix: A problem that converting failed when switching the language of DVDFab to ZH-TW.\nFix: A crash problem when previewing file source in certain cases.\nFix: A crash problem when converting .avi file in certain cases.\nFix: A freeze problem when converting 2D file source to 3D format.\nFix: A freeze problem when creating to Blu-ray in certain cases.\nFix: A problem that the ripped mpeg4 and mp4 files, which were created by DVDFab, cannot be opened in Video Converter and DVD/Blu-ray Creator.\nFix: A problem that the created DVD disc cannot be played on PS3, Panasonic 3D stand-alone player and Samsung stand-alone player.\nFix: A problem that cannot create DVD with external subtitle.\n\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. - Install the program, don't start.\n\n2. - Copy the contents of the folder &quot;Crack&quot; in &quot;C:  Program Files  DVDFab 9&quot;, replace.\n\n3. - Start the program and use.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstrucciones.\n\n1.- Instale el Programa, no lo inicie.\n\n2.- Copie el contenido de la carpeta &quot;Crack&quot; en &quot;C:Archivos de programaDVDFab 9&quot;, reemplazar.\n\n3.- Iniciar el programa y usar.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017098520e5fb83ce54b340ce034f810c91fab4a","amp;dn":"DVDFab+9.0.5.5+Multilanguage%2Bcrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017098520e5fb83ce54b340ce034f810c91fab4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,112,152,82,14,95,184,60,229,75,52,12,224,52,248,16,201,31,171,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
