Singers like Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also did a great deal to pioneer the form, but Charles did even more to devise a new form of black pop by merging '50s R&amp;B with gospel-powered vocals, adding plenty of flavor from contemporary jazz, blues, and (in the '60s) country. Then there was his singing; his style was among the most emotional and easily identifiable of any 20th century performer, up there with the likes of Elvis and Billie Holiday. He was also a superb keyboard player, arranger, and bandleader. The brilliance of his 1950s and '60s work, however, can't obscure the fact that he made few classic tracks after the mid-'60s, though he recorded often and performed until the year before his death. \n\n\nGenre................: R&amp;B / Soul\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Rhino\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Mess Around\n02.I've Got A Woman\n03.A Fool For You\n04.Greenbacks\n05.Drown In My Own Tears\n06.Hallelujah I Love Her So\n07.Lonely Avenue\n08.Ain't That Love\n09.(Night Time Is) The Right Time\n10.What'd I Say Parts I &amp; II\n11.Don't Let The Sun Catch You Cryin'\n12.Them That Got\n13.Sticks And Stones\n14.Georgia On My Mind\n15.Ruby\n16.One Mint Julep\n17.I've Got News For You\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Hit The Road Jack\n02.Unchain My Heart\n03.But On The Other Hand Baby\n04.Hide 'Nor Hair\n05.At The Club\n06.I Can't Stop Loving You\n07.You Don't Know Me\n08.You Are My Sunshine\n09.Don't Set Me Free\n10.Take These Chains From My Heart\n11.No One\n12.Busted\n13.Crying Time\n14.Together Again\n15.Let's Go Get Stoned\n16.Yesterday\n17.America The Beautiful\n18.Seven Spanish Angels (Feat.
