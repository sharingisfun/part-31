Webster\nPublisher: CRC\nPublication Date: 2003-07-15\nNumber Of Pages: 768\n\nThe CRC Principles and Applications in Engineering series is a library of convenient, economical references sharply focused on particular engineering topics and subspecialties. Each volume in the series comprises chapters carefully selected from CRC's bestselling handbooks, logically organized for optimum convenience, and thoughtfully priced to fit every budget.\n\nElectrical Measurement, Signal Processing, and Displays describes the use of instruments and techniques for practical measurement of electromagnetic variables, signal processing equipment and parameters, and various types of displays, from cathode ray tubes to LED devices. For this volume, chapters relevant to these topics were culled from the bestselling Measurement, Instrumentation, and Sensors Handbook and revised by their original authors to bring them thoroughly up to date.\n\nThis is a concise, well-illustrated, and highly practical reference. It sets forth the principles, formulas, and equations engineers and scientists need for solving the instrumentation and measurement questions they encounter in practice, particularly when problems arise in areas outside their own specialties.\n\n*Chapters logically organized by measurement problem and contributed by an international panel of experts\n\n*Information presented on three levels: basic exposition for newcomers to the field; a detailed discussion and mathematical treatment; and advanced applications, evaluations, and directions for future study\n\n*A full set of references in each chapter\n\n\n\n1 Voltage Measurement\n2 Current Measurement\n3 Power Measurement\n4 Power Factor Measurement\n5 Phase Measurement\n6 Energy Measurement\n7 Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity\n8 Charge Measurement\n9 Capacitance and Capacitance Measurements\n10 Permittivity Measurement\n11 Electric Field Strength\n12 Magnetic Field Measurement\n13 Permeability and Hysteresis Measurement\n14 Inductance Measurement\n15 Immittance Measurement\n16 Q Factor Measurement\n17 Distortion Measurement\n18 Noise Measurement\n19 Microwave Measurement\n20 Amplifiers and Signal Conditioners\n21 Modulation\n22 Filters\n23 Spectrum Analysis and Correlation\n24 Applied Intelligence Processing\n25 Analog-to-Digital Converters\n26 Computers\n27 Telemetry\n28 Sensor Networks and Communication\n29 Electromagnetic Compatibility\n30 Human Factors in Displays\n31 Cathode Ray Tube Displays\n32 Liquid Crystal Displays\n33 Plasma-Driven Flat Panel Displays\n34 Electroluminescent Displays\n35 Light-Emitting Diode Displays\n36 Reading/Recording Devices\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e37bd36b1f83406aa8107aaa224c0be4e37929f3","amp;dn":"Electrical+Measurement%2C+Signal+Processing%2C+and+Displays+By+John+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e37bd36b1f83406aa8107aaa224c0be4e37929f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,123,211,107,31,131,64,106,168,16,122,170,34,76,11,228,227,121,41,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
