It's probably not going to come out until next year,&quot; the Guardian reports. The album was ultimately shelved indefinitely, and while a steady stream of posthumous releases and reissues have satisfied Zappa fans in the following decades, Dance Me This was all but forgotten until Zappa's widow Gail Zappa began hinting at the final album's eventual arrival in 2011.\n\nAccording to the Zappa Family Trust, Dance Me This is &quot;the last title FZ finished in 1993 along with Trance-Fusion; the last chapter in his Master Work, Civilization Phaze III.&quot; &quot;This is it. #100. The LAST album by Frank Zappa. Tap your foot algorithmically to this, &quot; the estate adds. The album's title track reportedly features a recording of Tuvan &quot;throat singers,&quot; members of a northern China tribe that Zappa accompanied with a Synclavier composition.\n\nOne of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarist of All Time, Zappa switched to the Synclavier as his main compositional tool in 1984 with a pair of albums, Francesco Zappa and Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger. Zappa continued to experiment with the pioneering electronic music device even as he battled terminal prostate cancer, resulting in both Dance Me This and 1994's Civilization Phaze III.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-zappas-final-album-dance-me-this-plots-release-date-20150404#ixzz3e4yxExr4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/frank-zappas-final-album-dance-me-this-plots-release-date-20150404#ixzz3e4yxExr4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFrank Zappa - Dance Me This\nLabel: Zappa Records - ZPCD170\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 19 Jun 2015\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Progressive, Folk, World &amp; Country\n \nTracklist:\n\n1 \tDance Me This \t2:01\n2 \tPachuco Gavotte \t3:27\n3 \tWolf Harbor Movement I \t8:02\n4 \tWolf Harbor Movement II \t6:53\n5 \tWolf Harbor Movement III \t6:09\n6 \tWolf Harbor Movement IV \t3:38\n7 \tWolf Harbor Movement V \t3:09\n8 \tGoat Polo \t3:04\n9 \tRykoniki \t1:59\n10 \tPiano \t7:09\n11 \tCalculus \t2:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3d4c5fec8bb60c33a03774e808bebeb61868c0","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Dance+Me+This+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3d4c5fec8bb60c33a03774e808bebeb61868c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,61,76,95,236,139,182,12,51,160,55,116,232,8,190,190,182,24,104,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
