At the end of 2001, Cho ceased syndication, partly because editors kept censoring it, and announced he would publish it directly in comic book format.\nCho self-published the comic book at first, with Image Comics taking over printing and distribution with issue #27. The comic book went on a hiatus in early 2004, after issue #36.  June 2006 saw the publication of issue #37, and Cho commented that he would be &quot;trying to have couple of issues of Liberty Meadows out per year&quot;.\n\nTop ten reasons why you should read Liberty Meadows;\n\n1. Main character Brandy was inspired in part by Lynda Carter.\n2. There's a wiener dog named Oscar.\n3. PvP character guest appearances.\n4. There's a male chauvinist pig who's really a pig.\n5. Classic mushy love story that even men can appreciate.\n6. Really REALLY good art! Creator Frank Cho could draw ANYTHING and make it look amazing.\n7. Brandy is positively drool-inspiring for both her physical attributes and her personality.\n8. Easy story to get into without having to know 25 thousand years worth of comic book back-history.\n9. Funnyfunnyfunny!\n10. Liberty Meadows had a moment of silence after R.A. Salvatore's Star Wars novel Vector Prime killed Chewbacca.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949bbaa82b222aaf9b36c210c81a97c6d38a2e8b","amp;dn":"Liberty+Meadows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949bbaa82b222aaf9b36c210c81a97c6d38a2e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,155,186,168,43,34,42,175,155,54,194,16,200,26,151,198,211,138,46,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
