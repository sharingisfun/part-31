Like Moore's prior album Wild Frontier, this album contains elements of his Celtic roots. The instrumental track &quot;Dunluce&quot; is named after Dunluce Castle in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe track &quot;Led Clones,&quot; with Ozzy Osbourne sharing lead vocals with Moore, pokes fun at bands such as Kingdom Come who were quite popular at the time and were based on a Led Zeppelin type sound and image; it also appeared on a compilation album. Moore again pays tribute to the memory of his long-time friend and colleague Phil Lynott with the song &quot;Blood of Emeralds&quot;.\n\nfrom allmusic.com:\nReview by Eduardo Rivadavia \n\n\nGary Moore's 1989 release, After the War features a return to the metal guitar riffing of his 80's records (&quot;Speak for Yourself&quot; and &quot;Running From The Storm&quot;), while continuing to explore more conventional pop dynamics with mixed results - it works great on &quot;Ready to Love.&quot; Also, after dedicating his last album to fallen childhood friend and musical partner in crime, Philip Lynott, Moore finally honored him in song with the moving &quot;Blood of Emeralds.&quot; As it turned out, this would be Gary Moore's last hard rock album before becoming a &quot;born-again&quot; bluesman\n\n&quot;After the War&quot; is the last conventional hard rock album by Moore until Dark Days in Paradise (1997); the next album marked a departure into blues.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d632034986c15f16964b3bd30c613f75712e1d","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore-+After+The+War%281989%29orig.+Vinyl+digitization+24-96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d632034986c15f16964b3bd30c613f75712e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,214,50,3,73,134,193,95,22,150,75,59,211,12,97,63,117,113,46,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
