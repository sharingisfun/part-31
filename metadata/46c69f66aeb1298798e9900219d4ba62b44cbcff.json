I noticed a bit of a difference in the two episodes of the program shown here when Hendrix is interviewed by Cavett. In the first interview, Hendrix appears a lot more relaxed than in the second program interview. He seemed much more troubled in that second interview. Everyone around him (record execs, manager, etc.) demanded so much from this virtuoso that in the end it drove him over the edge. But as soon as he picked up his guitar you could see he left our world and went into another dimension somewhere else that was beautiful to see and more so to hear. I highly recommend everyone who is a fan of Hendrix to see this one of a kind Hendrix experience on network TV.\nAuthor: thompson62208 from St Louis, MO\n\n----------------\n| Release note |\n----------------\n The Dick Cavett Show represented Jimi's US network television debut and this special collection features complete live performances of &quot;Izabella&quot;, &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, and &quot;Hear My Train A Comin'. Jimi's insightful interviews with Cavett touched upon a variety of personal and professional issues ranging from his stint as a US Army paratrooper to his celebrated rendition of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; at the Woodstock Festival. These conversations with Cavett helped reveal the humor, passion, and intelligence of the man behind such rock classics as Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland. The complete collection of Jimi Hendrix's celebrated appearances on The Dick Cavett Show is now available for the very first time.In addition to the sixtyminute documentary, both of Jimi's Cavett appearances are presented individually, in their entirety, complete with each program's opening monologue.This deluxe edition also includes a new, behind the scenes documentary created especially for this release. The documentary provides the inside story of Hendrix's two unforgettable Cavett appearancesas well as the one he missed at the last minutea special Woodstock program which aired just hours after the conclusion of Jimi's legendary performance at the festival site. The program features interviews with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox from the Jimi Hendrix Experience, as well as new commentary from Dick Cavett.\n90 minutes // mono and stereo \n\n---------------\n| Ripper note |\n---------------\n  Awesome versions of Izabella and Machinegun on a white Gibson SG Custom.  Not worth buying. But well worth a download if you are a Hendrixfan.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c69f66aeb1298798e9900219d4ba62b44cbcff","amp;dn":"Jimi_Hendrix-Dick_Cavett_Show.PAL.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c69f66aeb1298798e9900219d4ba62b44cbcff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,198,159,102,174,177,41,135,152,233,144,2,25,212,186,98,180,76,188,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
