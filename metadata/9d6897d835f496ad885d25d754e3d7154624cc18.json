Nowuen, one of the greatest of all spiritual writers, invites us to search deeply for the well-springs that nourish true ministry in his classic The Way of the Heart. Interweaving the solitude, silence, and prayer of the fifth-century Egyptian Desert Fathers and Mothers with our contemporary search for an authentic spirituality, The Way of the Heart not only leads us to a fuller encounter with God, but to a more creative ministry with our fellow human beings. Here is one of the most profound works from a writer known for his fresh and perceptive insights - and who stands alongside C.S. Lewis and Thomas Merton as an essential Christian scholar and thinker.\n\nReview\n\nClear, precise, biblically founded guidance...Skillfully blends knowledge of psychological growth with the great Christian traditions. - Commonweal\n\nBrings desert spirituality to bear upon the contemporary scene. ... Hauntingly relevant for us today. - Christianity Today\n\nGemlike in its clarity. - The Christian Century\n\nInspiring, to the point, and eminently practical in his advice about living spiritually in the world of today. - Spiritual Book News\n\nOn the long road itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to have Nouwen and his divining rod. Deftly he bends toward the drop of spiritual wisdom caked in the most ordinary things. - Helen Prejean, C.S.J., author of Dead Man Walking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6897d835f496ad885d25d754e3d7154624cc18","amp;dn":"Henri+Nouwen+-+The+Way+of+the+Heart+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6897d835f496ad885d25d754e3d7154624cc18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,104,151,216,53,244,150,173,136,93,37,215,84,227,215,21,70,36,204,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
