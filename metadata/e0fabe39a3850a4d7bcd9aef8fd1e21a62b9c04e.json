Written by experienced language teachers at the \n Open University, this book offers crucial and practical advice on important areas such as: - choosing the language and study programme - setting \n personal goals for language learning and monitoring progress - using ICT to support language learning. \n\n Each of the ten chapters feature a number of exercises in order to help students assess the ways they learn and consider where improvements can be \n made, making the most of media available and how to use resources effectively. Designed primarily for undergraduate and postgraduate students \n studying courses that involve a language component, this study guide is more than relevant to anyone learning a language in any situation. \n Whatever their motivation and goals, this book will help students to realize their potential and open their minds to new cultures, peoples and heritage.\n\n PLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n &quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0fabe39a3850a4d7bcd9aef8fd1e21a62b9c04e","amp;dn":"Success+With+Languages%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0fabe39a3850a4d7bcd9aef8fd1e21a62b9c04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,250,190,57,163,133,10,77,123,205,154,239,143,209,226,26,98,185,192,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
