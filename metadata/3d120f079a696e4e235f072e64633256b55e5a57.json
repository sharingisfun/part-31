They deliver a rowdy, whiskey-drenched, antiheroic brand of rocked-up honky-tonk that unabashedly conjures up memories of Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr., and other rough-and-rowdy country &quot;outlaws&quot; of yesteryear. Montgomery and Gentry wear these influences well on serviceable cuts like &quot;Hillbilly Shoes&quot; and &quot;Didn&amp;#039;t Your Mama Tell Ya,&quot; but do them a disservice on unremarkable ballads like &quot;Trying to Survive&quot; and &quot;If a Broken Heart Could Kill,&quot; and on their derivative-sounding cover of Charlie Daniels&amp;#039;s &quot;All Night Long.&quot; The utter lack of original material on their debut CD is somewhat suspect, yet on killer cuts like the painfully confessional &quot;Self Made Man&quot; and the morally insightful &quot;Daddy Won&amp;#039;t Sell The Farm&quot; they do show a few sparks of innovation amid all the ragged honky-tonk smoke and fire\n\nInformation Disc:\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Artist:    Montgomery Gentry\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Title:     Tattoos &amp; Scars\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Year:     1999\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Genre:    Country - Contemporary Country\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Tipe:      Album\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Format:   Mp3\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Bitrate:   192 Kbps / 44100 Hz /  Joint Stereo\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Size:      54.2 Mb\n\n\nList of Themes:\n\n01.
