This is a different gaming experience: an opportunity to slow down, zone out and focus on a task that's challenging but not stressful, a set of gentle puzzles for the mind and fingers to solve.\n\nThe goal of the game is to paint wooden sculptures by wrapping them in rope - a task that may sound simple but has surprising complexity. Each of the levels presents a spatial puzzle that becomes obvious through inspection. Some levels feature paint bombs that are helpful in covering complex areas of the object.\n\nZen Bound 2 is a calm and meditative gameplay experience, with tactile, dusty visuals and a sublime, enveloping soundtrack by the sensational electronic artist 'Ghost Monkey'.\nKey features:\n\n    * Look and feel of an Arcade game from 1985-1987\n    * 6 levels, 14 bosses and more than 40 enemies\n    * 50 minutes of gameplay\n    * 4 different endings based on merits and secrets\n    * Backgrounds, characters and creatures based in medieval myths from Spain and the rest of Europe\n\n\nScreenshots:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/9951/malditacastilla03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/9951/malditacastilla03.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/3112/malditacastilla04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/3112/malditacastilla04.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1888/malditacastilla07.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1888/malditacastilla07.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/4957/malditacastilla11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/4957/malditacastilla11.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06808115ee6f9a3a1a3fee8c7ca6083eaadf2762","amp;dn":"Maldita+Castilla+%282012%29++PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06808115ee6f9a3a1a3fee8c7ca6083eaadf2762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,128,129,21,238,111,154,58,26,63,238,140,124,166,8,62,170,223,39,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
