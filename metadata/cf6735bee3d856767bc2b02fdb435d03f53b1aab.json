While technically chic-lit with plenty of Hinglish dialogues, Chauhan's books are surprisingly well-written, often laugh-out-loud-funny and generally good, light-hearted, fun reads. Here's hoping for a lot more from her in the coming years -- more great writing, perhaps with a lighter dose of the chic-lit!\nGenre: Fiction/Indian/Contemporary\n\n\n1. The Zoya Factor (2008)\nWhen the younger players in India's cricket team find out that advertising executive Zoya Singh Solanki was born at the very moment India won the world cup back in 1983, they are intrigued. When eating breakfast with her is regularly followed by victories on the field, they are impressed. They decide she is a lucky charm. Nearly all of them, anyway..\n\n2. Battle for Bittora (2010)\nTwenty-five-year-old Jinni lives in Mumbai, works in a hip animation studio and is perfectly happy with her carefree and independent existence. Until her bossy grandmother shows up and announces that it is Jinni's 'duty' to drop everything and come and contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from their sleepy hometown, Bittora. Of course Jinni swears she won't. But she soon ends up swathed in cotton saris and frumpy blouses, battling prickly heat, corruption and accusations of nymphomania as candidate Sarojini Pande, a daughter of the illustrious Pande dynasty of Pavit Pradesh. And if life isn't fun enough already, her main opposition turns out to be Bittora ex-royal, Zain Altaf Khan an irritatingly idealistic though undeniably lustworthy individual with whom Jinni shares a complicated history... Enlivened by Chauhan s characteristic brand of wicked humour and sexy romanticism, this is a rollicking new tale of young India.\n\n3. Those Pricey Thakur Girls (2012)\nIn a sprawling bungalow on New DelhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s posh Hailey Road, Justice Laxmi Narayan Thakur and his wife Mamta spend their days watching anxiously over their five beautiful (but troublesome) alphabetically named daughters. Anjini, married but childless and an incorrigible flirt; Binodini, very worried about her childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hissa in the family property; Chandralekha, who eloped with a foreigner on the eve of her wedding; Eshwari, who is just a little too popular at Modern School Barakhamba Road; and the JudgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favourite (though fathers shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have favourites): the quietly fiery Debjani, champion of all the stray animals on Hailey Road, who reads the English news on DD and clashes constantly with investigative journalist Dylan Singh Shekhawat, he of shining professional credentials but tarnished personal reputation, crushingly dismissive of her employerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstate sponsored propagandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ but always seeking her out with half-sarcastic, half-intrigued dark eyes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6735bee3d856767bc2b02fdb435d03f53b1aab","amp;dn":"Anuja+Chauhan+-+3+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6735bee3d856767bc2b02fdb435d03f53b1aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,103,53,190,227,216,86,118,123,194,176,47,219,67,93,3,245,59,26,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
