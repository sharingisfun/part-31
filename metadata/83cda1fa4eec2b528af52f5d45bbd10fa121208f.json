If he's not well known today, much of that can be accorded to his dropping a promising career at the age of 20 to become a Roman Catholic priest. For the first few years of his priestly training Kayser was compositionally very active, but after that he largely devoted himself to organ composition and performance. In 1964 he was released by request from his vows, married, and taught score analysis and instrumentation at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. The musical scene had completely changed, with enthusiasts of the serial avant-garde having a major say in concerts, radio, and commissions; critics found Kayser's music old-fashioned and traditional, where he was hailed in his youth for his distinctive style. Little of his work has been recorded for international release, but more is slowly becoming available.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
