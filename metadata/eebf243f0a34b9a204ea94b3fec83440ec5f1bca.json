With its Police-styled rhythms, catchy guitar hooks, wailing saxophones, and off-kilter sense of humor, the band's debut album, Business as Usual, became an international blockbuster, breaking the American record for the most weeks a debut spent at the top of the charts. Their funny, irreverent videos became MTV favorites, helping send &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; and &quot;Down Under&quot; to number one. Men at Work's momentum sustained them through their second album, 1983's Cargo, before the bottom fell out of the band's popularity. After releasing Two Hearts in 1985, Men at Work broke up, becoming one of the better-remembered phenomena of new wave. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eebf243f0a34b9a204ea94b3fec83440ec5f1bca","amp;dn":"Men+At+Work+-+Contraband","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eebf243f0a34b9a204ea94b3fec83440ec5f1bca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,191,36,63,10,52,185,162,4,234,148,179,254,200,52,64,236,95,27,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
