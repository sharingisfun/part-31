You don't necessarily look for unusual interpretations of your Christmas music; you just want those old favorites sung well, and for the most part, that's what you got from Streisand. She did lead off with &quot;Jingle Bells?&quot; into which she injected some of her trademark humor while performing at a breakneck pace. Marty Paich arranged and conducted the secular songs like &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;White Christmas,&quot; which occupied side one, while Ray Ellis handled the religious material on side two. But both were traditional in their charts, and Streisand gave her singing just enough personality without getting in the way of the familiar songs. They were trying to make a timeless classic, and that's what they achieved.\n\nAmazon Review:\nYou haven't heard &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; until you've heard Barbra Streisand's version. Sounding more like a bebop Santa on A Christmas Album's rousing opening track, Streisand keenly races through the stanzas, toying with the words, pushing the song's tempos, and generally having a lot of fun. After that, she gets down to the more serious side of holiday offerings, with tracks that include &quot;My Favorite Things,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; &quot;Silent Night,&quot; &quot;The Christmas Song,&quot; and others. At times this world-class singer can bowl you over with her range, sensuality, and emotion, and when she visits &quot;Ave Maria&quot; or closes with &quot;The Lord's Prayer,&quot; it's easy to see why this is one singular Streisand record that has traveled so well for so many years. A classy classic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735df440cc3a80a2e3d6ab792ee0d634662c960a","amp;dn":"Barbra+Streisand+-+A+Christmas+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735df440cc3a80a2e3d6ab792ee0d634662c960a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,93,244,64,204,58,128,162,227,214,171,121,46,224,214,52,102,44,150,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
