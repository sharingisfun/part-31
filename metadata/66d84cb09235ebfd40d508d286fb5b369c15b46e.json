They were formed in the late 1970s in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when singer Annie &quot;Holly&quot; Woods met guitarist Brian Allen. The band's constantly shifting line-up was originally augmented by guitarist/backing vocalist Sharon Alton, keyboardist Scott Kreyer, bassist Nick Costello, and drummer Jimmy Fox.\n\nTheir first album, Lookin' for Trouble, was released in 1980, and lead single &quot;Even The Score&quot; was a minor hit, just missing the Canadian Top 40. Head On (1981) followed , after which Costello and Fox left the band to be replaced by Gary LaLonde (later of Honeymoon Suite) and Barry Connors (later of Coney Hatch).\n\nThis sextet recorded Get It on Credit (1982), with lead single &quot;Your Daddy Don't Know&quot; reaching top 5 in Canada, and hitting #77 in the US. It remains their best known hit. Lalonde was then replaced by Mike Gingrich for 1983's Girls' Night Out in 1983. This album also received attention, as did the band's Greatest Hits album of 1984.\n\nThere were subsequently several exits and entrances in 1984/85, with founding members Allen and Alton leaving, along with drummer Connors. They were replaced by Marty Walsh (guitars), Daryl Alvara (guitars) and Paul Hanna (drums), and the band rechristened themselves Holly Woods and Toronto. In 1985, the re-vamped sextet released their final album, Assault and Flattery. It featured the single &quot;New Romance&quot;, written by Holly Knight and Anton Fig.\n\nIn 1985, the band was literally forced into breaking up when Solid Gold Records filed for bankruptcy protection. Woods and Kreyer ended up relocating to Atlanta, Georgia where they went into Lowery Studios to record a solo album by Woods. However, the album was shelved for over 20 years, until Cyclone Records acquired the rights to the &quot;lost&quot; masters and released the album in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1984\n\n\nThe Greatest Hits, Toronto's fifth album, was released in 1984, and features two new studio tracks: &quot;Andrea&quot; and &quot;Me Generation&quot;. The CD release features the bonus track &quot;What About Love&quot;, as well as music videos for three songs.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Your Daddy Don't Know&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Lookin' for Trouble&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Start Tellin' the Truth&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Even the Score&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Andrea&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Ready to Make Up&quot;\n8.\t&quot;All I Need&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Silver Screen&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Girls' Night Out&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Head On&quot;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d84cb09235ebfd40d508d286fb5b369c15b46e","amp;dn":"Toronto+-+Greatest+Hits+1984+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d84cb09235ebfd40d508d286fb5b369c15b46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,216,76,176,146,53,235,253,64,213,8,210,134,251,91,54,156,21,180,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
