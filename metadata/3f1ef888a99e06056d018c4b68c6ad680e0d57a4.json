The session was recorded at KUT\npublic radio in Texas.    Lanois and  renowned jazz drummer Brian Blade\nperformed in the stationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s studio.  (Lanois remarked that they really\nliked the set up and that it challenged them to  perform at their best on the fly.) \n\nI recorded the show in wav and have uploaded this in flac to try and retain \nas much of the quality as possible.  It sounds quite good consideringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.  \nIf you are a Lanois fan, then I think you will like this torrent.\n\nIn this torrent you will find four songs with the interview edited out as well as the original unedited interview with the perfomrances in tact as heard on the original broadcast, (for the purists.) Cheers!\n\nThis is from the KUT website:Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â \nKUT, June 5, 2008 - One of our favorite sessions at KUT during this year's South by Southwest festival was with Daniel Lanois, a notable producer, musician, and now filmmaker. Performing with Brian Blade, one of jazz's most accomplished and remarkable drummers, Lanois brought no small amount of gravitas to our small vintage studio. His gentle relationship with the steel guitar astounded the small group that gathered to watch his interview and performance. And, as always, his quiet intellect raised the level of discourse during a week usually overwhelmed by fast-talking and hurried appreciation. Lanois discussed the state of the music world with host David Brown, commenting on the way we relate to and digest media in its current form. &quot;Bite-sized&quot; bits of music in the form of quick downloads, short video clips, brief glances, and short stares pervade our consciousness, and in part thanks to television, we're forced to swallow it all whole and reflect on it later. &quot;We're used to advertising blending into our entertainment until it all becomes a soundbite,&quot; Lanois said. &quot;But life is not made of soundbites.&quot;\nHe scratched his head as he says this, as if part of him were putting into words a philosophy that had always been there, waiting to be realized. &quot;If you're walking down the street, life is made of segments, conversations, and trickling streams, expected and unexpected,&quot; Lanois continued. &quot;You turn a corner, see a friend, and continue down the road. And music should never stop representing that pace of life.&quot;  In many ways, Lanois' music is a perfect output for this way of thinking, as it reveals itself to the listener slowly, incrementally, and subtly. \nOriginally recorded March 15, 2008.\n\n01-\tPanorama ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ JJ Leaves LA\n02-\tHere Is What Is\n03-\tJolie Louise\n04-\tThe Maker\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1ef888a99e06056d018c4b68c6ad680e0d57a4","amp;dn":"Daniel+Lanois+-+4+Songs+KUT+Studio+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1ef888a99e06056d018c4b68c6ad680e0d57a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,30,248,136,169,158,6,5,109,1,140,75,104,198,173,104,14,13,87,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
