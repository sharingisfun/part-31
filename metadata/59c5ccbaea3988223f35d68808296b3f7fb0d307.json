Maurice Denham plays an avuncular Rumpole, who refers to judges as &quot;an old sweetheart&quot;, is forever in trouble with the more ambitious members of his Chambers, and can be found imbibing a bottle of &quot;ChÃƒÂ¢teau Thames Embankment&quot; budget claret at Pomeroy's Wine Bar.\n\nDelightful listening. The Timothy West / Benedict Cumberbatch iterations of Rumpole are posted elsewhere, or will be in due course.
