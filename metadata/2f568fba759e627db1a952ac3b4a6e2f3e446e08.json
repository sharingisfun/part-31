When brazilian art master Di Cavalcanti died, Glauber Rocha went to his funeral... with a camera. The short movie shows Cavalcanti`s corpse in the coffin, the funeral, and his family yelling at Rocha to get out of there with that camera, while in the background we hear Jorge Ben singing &quot;Umbabarauma, homem gol&quot;, a famous samba-funk song about a famous brazilian soccer player. The guts make the myth.\n\nDownload Links:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f568fba759e627db1a952ac3b4a6e2f3e446e08","amp;dn":"Di+Cavalcanti+Di+Glauber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f568fba759e627db1a952ac3b4a6e2f3e446e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,86,143,186,117,158,98,125,177,169,82,172,59,74,110,47,62,68,110,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
