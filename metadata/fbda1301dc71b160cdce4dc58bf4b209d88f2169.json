Unearthed, once again, by Light In The Attic Records, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another treat for fans new and old, designed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as RodriguezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of a perfect pop album.\n\nComing From Reality found Rodriguez decamping from Detroit to LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lansdowne Studios, where the album was recorded with some of the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top talent including Chris Spedding (Sex Pistols, Dusty Springfield, Harry Nilsson) and producer Steve Rowland (The Pretty Things, PJ Proby and the man who discovered The Cure), who recalls Coming From Reality as his favourite ever recording project.\n\nHighlights include the super-poppy Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Whom It May ConcernÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rocky RaccoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-inspired Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Most Disgusting SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and period piece Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeikkiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Suburbia Bus TourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The CD reissue also includes three previously unreleased bonus tracks recorded in Detroit in 1972 with Cold Fact collaborators Mike Theodore &amp; Dennis Coffey, representing the last thing they ever did together.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rodriguez story keeps gathering pace. A Swedish documentary company are working on a feature length documentary about the enigmatic performerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and music, and Rodriguez is planning to bring his live show to the UK and Europe come Spring/Summer 2009, along with further North America touring.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an extraordinary trip,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Rodriguez of his new lease on life. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It feels like Picasso, Monet. All these exciting new thoughts coming at me. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lucky to have this second chance. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very real and totally unexpected.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSixto Rodriguez, then. Still coming from reality, and bigger than ever before.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbda1301dc71b160cdce4dc58bf4b209d88f2169","amp;dn":"Rodriguez+-+Coming+From+Reality+%5B1971%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbda1301dc71b160cdce4dc58bf4b209d88f2169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,218,19,1,220,113,177,96,205,206,77,197,139,244,178,9,216,143,33,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
