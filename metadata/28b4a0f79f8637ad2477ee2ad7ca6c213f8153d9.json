Volume one concentrates on the Ozzy days, and contains a lot of performances from that era, the infamous video for paranoid, shot in Belgium among others, as well as rare footage - like a top of the pops performance of &quot;Never say die&quot;. Mind ya, just because of the sheer age of some of those clips, the image can get pretty dodgy now and then, and well, the sound is obviously an expansion of the stereophonic image. believable perhaps, but easily distinguishable as fake by the trained ear. In between the clips you get some juicy snippets from the members of the band, minus the Ozman himself, candidly talking about &quot;the early days&quot;. Ah those crazy guys in Sabbath. Anyhow, moving to Volume two, we got the one and only, The King of Rock'n Roll, Ronnie James Dio, talking about his days in Sabbath, also the videos of &quot;Neon Knights&quot; and &quot;Die young&quot;, but for fuck's sake, the interviews are dubbed over the intros and outcross of the songs, ruining some of them completely. I can't believe that they elected to do that. They could have done it as commentary or sty. It certainly is a very big con, as far as buying vol two is concerned. Moving on we got the Gillan album, complete with the Spinal Tap, Stonehenge incident, the Hughes days (the 7th Star) and last but not least Tony &quot;The Pussy&quot; Martin's Era, represented by The &quot;Headless cross&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Feels good to me&quot; videos. The second DVD, ends with a couple of promo clips from the Reunion with Dio era of Dehumanise. Pretty strong Stuff, but again there's a complete ruination of certain songs by some stupid intervention. The menu design is greatly stylized, and most of the features are easily accessible. Overall, pretty good, but it could still have been done better.\n\n**********************************************************\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo DVD-1 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3291279\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**********************************************************\n\n\nFormer releases from me on TPB:\nWelle: Erdball DVD-5 + CD \nRamones: End of the Century (NTSC DVD-9) \nBeCool PAL DVD-5 \nMy Big Fat Greek Life DVD-5 \nVarannan vecka DVD-9 \nStockholm Boogie DVD-5 \nTjenare Kungen DVD-5 \nLed Zeppelin PAL - DVD 1 of 2 \nDVD-9 Led Zeppelin PAL - DVD 2 of 2 DVD-9 \nVideodrome - PAL DVD - DVD-5 \nThe Black Sabbath Story - Vol 1: 1970-1978 PAL DVD \nCinema Paradiso [DIRECTOR'S CUT] PAL DVD \nR E M - In View: The Best of R E M 1988-2003 - PAL DVD \nThe POLICE-Every Breath You Take - PAL DVD + Cover \nThe Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 2 of 2\n The Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 1 of 2 \nBill Wyman s (The Rolling Stones) Blues Odyssey - PAL DVD + COVER \nPunk Generation - PAL DVD \nThe Clash - Rude Boy: Special Edition PAL DVD \nMad Max 1 - PAL DVD - SWESUB \nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 2 of 2 - PAL DVD \nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 1 of 2 - PAL DVD \nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 2 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD \nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 1 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD \nThe Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story - PAL - DVD \nZiggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars - The Motion Picture - PAL DVD \nSimon &amp; Garfunkel - The Concert in Central Park 1981 - PAL DVD \nGimme Some Truth - John Lennons Imagine Documentary PAL DVD \nPopulÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rmusik FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n Vittula 2004 SWEDISH - SUOMALAINEN FULL DVD-9 \nThe Blue Light - Ao no hono-o - PAL DVD DIVA - PAL DVD \nTommy The Movie - 1975 - PAL DVD \nDeep Purple - Heavy Metal Pioneers - NTSC DVD \nThe Beatles - The First U.S Visit - PAL DVD \nWoodstock - PAL DVD \nRolling Stones Live at the Max - PAL DVD \nBob Dylan MTV UNPLUGGED - PAL DVD \nThe Ring - PAL DVD SCANDINAVIAN SUB \nRing 0 Birthday - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB \nRing 2 - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB \nBreaking Point.1975 - Svensktextad \nBullet proof Monk - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS \nAntikiller - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS DVD-5\nA Man Called Hero - Zhong hua ying xiong PAL DVD DVD-5\nThe Filth and the Fury &quot;Sex Pistols Documentary&quot; PAL DVD DVD-5 \nThe Twilight Samurai - Tasogare Seibei DVD-9\nDawn of the Dead 2004 NORDIC SUB PAL DVD-5 \nRed Lion - Akage DVD-5\nBichunmoo - Flying Warriors DVD-5 \nCradle 2 the Grave DVD-5\nShogun Assassin DVD-5 \n2046 DVD-5\nTai Chi Master DVD-5\nHair 1979 DVD-5 \n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b4a0f79f8637ad2477ee2ad7ca6c213f8153d9","amp;dn":"The+Black+Sabbath+Story+Vol.2+%28PAL+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28b4a0f79f8637ad2477ee2ad7ca6c213f8153d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,180,160,247,159,134,55,173,36,119,238,42,215,202,108,33,63,129,83,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
