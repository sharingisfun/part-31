CloneCD&amp;#039;s award-winning user interface allows you to copy almost any CD in just a few mouse clicks.\n\nSince the release of 5.0, CloneCD is not only able to copy CDs but also most DVD formats, such as DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R Dual Layer and DVD-RAM. The movies are copied 1:1 and therefore not modified (compressed). Note that to copy movie DVDs you also require AnyDVD.\n\nCloneCD also works with other formats such as ISO and UDF files and copies CDs/DVDs with the new SafeDisc 3 Copy Protection System. CloneCD allows you to create perfect 1:1 copies of your valuable original compact discs. Should your copy-protected music CD not play in your car audio, the backup created by CloneCD will.\n\nSlysoft combine knowledge and innovation with many years of experience and direct communication with customers to provide constant improvements, therefore making CloneCD the highest quality copying application around.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8243a92ba12876660841f153163cdd75fa58834","amp;dn":"CloneCD+5.3.0.1+WinALL+Cracked+-+Christley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8243a92ba12876660841f153163cdd75fa58834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,36,58,146,186,18,135,102,96,132,31,21,49,99,205,215,95,165,136,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
