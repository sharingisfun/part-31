It focuses on balancing poses, cardio, body detoxification, super sweaty flow, and strength training.\n\nPeak yoga poses include Utthita Padangusthasana, an extended hand-to-big-toe pose that helps improve balance while strengthening the ankles and legs. It also stretches the back of the legs.\n\nTwisting Half Moon is the sessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other peak pose, and is a twisting standing pose designed to improve balance while cleansing the organs and strengthening the thighs and ankles.\n\nGet ready to do some serious sweating as you move your body, connect to your breath, and otherwise flow into your day! Enjoy feeling relaxed and detoxified after spending 60 minutes &quot;wringing out&quot; your organs. Whether getting into this session at the beginning, middle, or end of your day, you'll always feel fantastic and cleansed by the class's end.
