There are other edits too, mostly as a result of said cut sublpots. In the end, I cut 15 minutes for each episode: Part 1 goes from 60 minutes to 45 minutes and Part 2 from 73 minutes to 58 minutes.\n\nEdited subtitles, synchronized to match the new runtime, are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa114ee39ad1af269b34cfdd425f03e52355f6e","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+2005+s04e17e18+The+End+of+Time+Fan+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa114ee39ad1af269b34cfdd425f03e52355f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,161,20,238,57,173,26,242,105,179,76,253,212,37,240,62,82,53,95,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
