It was released January 31, 2009 in Australia.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; was shot in late 2008, leaked to the internet on January 23, 2009, and officially premiered on Pink's YouTube channel on January 27, 2009.[4] It was directed by Dave Meyers. The video draws influences from the 1990 Stephen King based film Misery, as well as other similar thrillers, including 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'. It utilizes both the horror/thriller genre, while also being interpretable as a dark comedy.\n\n&quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; made a #46 debut on the Australian ARIA Charts the chart week of 19 January 2009, prior to its release date as a single. \n\nIt took &quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; a while after its release to chart in the United States. But after weeks of release spent on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Chart, the song debuted on #66 on The Billboard Hot 100 and climbed to # 40 a few weeks later. It's also been doing well digitally, entering the Hot Digital Songs chart at #70 and rising 26 spots to #44 the following week.\n\nReleased \tJanuary 31, 2009\nFormat \t\tDigital download, CD single\nRecorded \t2008\nGenre \t\tPop\nLength \t\t3:52\nLabel \t\tLaFace\nWriter(s) \tPink, Max Martin\nProducer \tMax Martin\n\nVideo Specs :\n\nFormat: Matroska (.mkv) | AVC\nNominal Bitrate: 1 529 kbps\nOverall Bitrate: 1 658 kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass [Extreme]\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nQuality Factor: 0.088\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.350\nDuration: 3 mins 48 secs\n\nAudio Specs :\n\nType: Vorbis\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannels: 2 channels\n\nBest Player: KMPlayer\n\nDon't Forget to say a little 'Thank You' and lots of SEEDs! :]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf44e020aa57b97a4a3e1ee2abe75a4a04d89bf","amp;dn":"Please+Don%5C%27t+Leave+Me+-+Pink+%5BUncensored%5D+720p+2009+chikezei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf44e020aa57b97a4a3e1ee2abe75a4a04d89bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,244,78,2,10,165,123,151,164,163,225,238,42,190,117,164,160,77,137,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
