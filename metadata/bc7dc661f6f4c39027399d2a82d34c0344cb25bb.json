The format isn't pretty, but it is literally the only ebook of the City of the Dead that I could find. And it started out as a .lit file, so that certainly didn't help. Despite the aesthetic flaws, though, the book is complete and- unlike the spamming links that litter Google search- entirely readable. \n\nHere's the summary:\n\nClaire DeWitt is not your average private investigator. She has brilliant deductive skills and is an ace at discovering evidence. But Claire also uses her dreams, omens, and mind-expanding herbs to help her solve mysteries, and relies on DÃƒÂ©tection Ã¢â‚¬â€ the only book published by the late, great, and mysterious French detective Jacques Silette.\n\nThe tattooed, pot-smoking Claire has just arrived in post-Katrina New Orleans, the city sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s avoided since her mentor, SiletteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s student Constance Darling, was murdered there. Claire is investigating the disappearance of Vic Willing, a prosecutor known for winning convictions in a homicide- plagued city. Has an angry criminal enacted revenge on Vic? Or did he use the storm as a means to disappear? Claire follows the clues, finding old friends and making new enemiesÃ¢â‚¬â€foremost among them Andray Fairview, a young gang member who just might hold the key to the mystery.\n\nLittered with memories of ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years as a girl detective in 1980s Brooklyn, Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead is a knockout start to a bracingly original new series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7dc661f6f4c39027399d2a82d34c0344cb25bb","amp;dn":"Sara+Gran-+Claire+DeWitt+and+the+City+of+the+Dead.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7dc661f6f4c39027399d2a82d34c0344cb25bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,125,198,97,246,244,195,144,39,57,157,42,130,211,76,3,68,203,37,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
