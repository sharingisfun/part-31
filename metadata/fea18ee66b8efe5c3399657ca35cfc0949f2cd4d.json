Ullman\n\nPublication Date: January 1, 1998 | ISBN-10: 0137903871 | ISBN-13: 978-0137903870 | Edition: 2\n\nWritten by a well-known computer science education and researcher. No previous knowledge of ML or functional programming is assumed. This is the first book that offers BOTH a highly accessible, step-by-step introductory tutorial on ML programming and a complete reference to, and explanation of, advanced features. The author uses a wide variety of digestible program examples to bring the reader along at a reasonable pace. More sophisticated programs and advanced concept topics balance out a book that is usable in a number of courses and settings for either self-study or class discussion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea18ee66b8efe5c3399657ca35cfc0949f2cd4d","amp;dn":"Elements+of+ML+Programming+-+ML97+Edition.djvu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea18ee66b8efe5c3399657ca35cfc0949f2cd4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,161,142,230,107,142,254,92,51,153,101,124,163,92,252,9,73,242,205,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
