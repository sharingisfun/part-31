Beagle ===\n\nmobi, epub &amp; pdf versions\n\n============================================\n\nThe Last Unicorn\n\n\nThe Last Unicorn is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's The Hobbit, \n\nLe Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Beagle writes a \n\nshimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:\n\nThe unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she \n\ndid not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color\n\nof snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she \n\nstill moved like a shadow on the sea.\n\nThe unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the \n\nothers. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he \n\nintended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of \n\nthe mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes \n\nin legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead \n\nwait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.\n\n============================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa73ac2f6a26a0ac1b10a800f425def8b7c4576","amp;dn":"The+Last+Unicorn+%28pdf%2C+mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa73ac2f6a26a0ac1b10a800f425def8b7c4576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,167,58,194,246,162,106,10,193,177,10,128,15,66,93,239,139,124,69,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
