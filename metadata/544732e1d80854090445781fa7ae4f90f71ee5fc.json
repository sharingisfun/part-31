Their name is Spanish for 'Go with God'. It is one of the most successful Belgian groups ever. Time Flies is their third studio album. Even more than the previous album, this is a melancholic album and is more gypsy and soul oriented. (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nVaya Con Dios - Time Flies 1992\n(Ariola BMG)\n\n 1. Time Flies    \n 2.
