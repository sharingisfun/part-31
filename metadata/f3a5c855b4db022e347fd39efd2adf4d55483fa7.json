Unlike other equalizers, you can freely adjust not only center frequency, gain and bandwidths, but also the filter slope for each band. The filter slope can be set anywhere from 3 dB to ultra-sharp 120 dB per octave. Needless to say, you can operate Equalize as a zero latency plug-in when using the minimum phase mode or choose to preserve the phase relationships in the linear phase mode. Equalize goes one step further, though, and introduces the unique mixed phase mode that allows you to set the latency freely in the range 5 to 120 milliseconds while preserving the phase relationships as far as possible. That gives a unique control over potential pre-ringing artifacts which is a common problem with linear phase filtering. Latency values below 20 milliseconds ensure that any pre-ringing is masked by the temporal masking of the human hearing while preserving the time-alignment across the audible frequency range.\n\nNew in Version 1.1.12[b][/b]\n\nFixed occasional CPU overloads in Pro Tools during audio scrubbing\nFixed problem with inactive gain knob in certain situations\nFixed problem with curve updates with disabled analyzers\nIncreased the maximum resonance to 24 dB\n\n\n\n[INSTALLATION]\n\n\n\n- Unrar with you favorite archiver, such as WinRar\n\n- Run Setup and Install\n\n- Insert Serial\n\n- Ok, It's Activated!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Thats it!
