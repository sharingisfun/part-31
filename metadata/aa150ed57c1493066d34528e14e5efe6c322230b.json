Access to billions of dollars worth of military kit, from helicopters to aircraft carriers, enabling filmmakers to make bigger and more spectacular battle scenes, which in turn generate more box office revenue. Providing they accept the Pentagon's advice, even toe the party line and show the US military in a positive light.\n\nSo is it a case of art imitating life, or a sinister force using art to influence life and death - and the public perception of both?\n\n[i]Empire[/i] will examine Hollywood, the Pentagon, and war.\n\nJoining us as guests: Oliver Stone, the eight times Academy Award-winning filmmaker; Michael Moore, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker; and Christopher Hedges, an author and the former Middle East bureau chief of the [i]New York Times[/i].\n\nOur interviewees this week are: Phil Strub, US Department of Defense Film Liaison Unit; Julian Barnes, Pentagon correspondent, [i]LA Times[/i]; David Robb, the author of [i]Operation Hollywood[/i]; Prof Klaus Dodds, the author of [i]Screening Terror[/i]; Matthew Alford, the author of [i]Reel Power[/i]; Prof Melani McAlister, the author of [i]Culture, Media, and US Interests in the Middle East[/i].\n\nmore info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/empire/2010/12/2010121681345363793.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/empire/2010/12/2010121681345363793.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=============================================================\n\nConverted To : MPEG4 Video, H264, AAC \nSize : 196MB\nDuration : 00:46:57 mins\nVideo : MPEG4 Video (H264) 480x270  25.00fps\nAudio : AAC 44100Hz stereo 107Kbps\n\nYou can also watch this program on Youtube here:\n\n=============================================================\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa150ed57c1493066d34528e14e5efe6c322230b","amp;dn":"Al+Jazeera%3A+Empire+-+Hollywood+and+the+war+machine+%28Chris+Hedges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa150ed57c1493066d34528e14e5efe6c322230b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,21,14,213,124,20,147,6,109,52,82,142,20,229,239,230,195,34,35,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
