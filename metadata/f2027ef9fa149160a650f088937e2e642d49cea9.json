It was originally published in Japan as Cat Shit One in 1998 by Softbank Publishing, but was renamed for the US release to parody the title of the film Apocalypse Now, which also took place during the Vietnam War. It was published in the UK (printed in Canada) in 2004 by ADV Manga. It was also released in Poland in 2006, also under the title Cat Shit One. It has been released in France, Belgium and Spain, as Cat Shit One, by GlÃƒÂ©nat in 2006.\n\nThe manga follows three American soldiers (who are anthropomorphic animals) in the Vietnam War named Botasky, Packy and Rats. All three are in the recon team called Cat Shit One. Each mission (or chapter) shows the daily activities of the reconnaissance group in Vietnam. There are sections of the manga which give brief history and truths behind the war, such as the types of weapons used by different countries and the activities of forces in the war. At the end of volume one there is a chapter called Dog Shit One Ã¢â‚¬â€ separate from the main story Ã¢â‚¬â€ showing human characters.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2027ef9fa149160a650f088937e2e642d49cea9","amp;dn":"Motofumi+Kobayashi%3A+Apocalypse+Meow+%28Cat+Shit+One%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2027ef9fa149160a650f088937e2e642d49cea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,2,126,249,250,20,145,96,166,80,240,136,147,126,46,100,45,73,206,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
