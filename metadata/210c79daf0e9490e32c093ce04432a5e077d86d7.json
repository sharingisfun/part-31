The audio actually sounds as if it's coming from almost 10 feet outside of the speakers. Well done Pablo Records.\n\nPart of a Fantasy sampler series that features musicians (and in this case a notable vocalist) performing the blues, this CD features Ella Fitzgerald on 11 performances taken from a variety of sessions. Although she never specialized in the blues, Ella had no difficulty swinging over blues changes and sometimes putting strong emotion into the lowdown variety. There is one song apiece from the '50s and '60s, while the remainder of the program dates from 1971-79. Ella's rendition of &quot;C-Jam Blues&quot; at the Santa Monica Civic in 1972 is a true classic, and other highlights include &quot;Duke's Place&quot; (with Duke Ellington's Orchestra in 1966), &quot;I'm Walkin',&quot; and the lengthy &quot;Basiella,&quot; with Count Basie's big band.\n\n\nOriginally produced by Norman Granz, these tracks were recorded live and in the studio between 1953 and 1979.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210c79daf0e9490e32c093ce04432a5e077d86d7","amp;dn":"Bluella%3A+Ella+Fitzgerald+Sings+The+Blues+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210c79daf0e9490e32c093ce04432a5e077d86d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,12,121,218,240,233,73,14,50,192,147,206,4,67,42,94,7,125,134,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
