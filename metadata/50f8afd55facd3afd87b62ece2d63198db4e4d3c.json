Seventeen-year-old Luca Vero is brilliant, gorgeousÃ¢â‚¬â€and accused of heresy. Cast out of his religious order for using the new science to question old superstitious beliefs, Luca is recruited into a secret sect: The Order of the Dragon, commissioned by Pope Nicholas V to investigate evil and danger in its many forms, and strange occurrences across Europe, in this yearÃ¢â‚¬â€the end of days.\n.\nIsolde is a seventeen-year-old girl shut up in a nunnery so she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t inherit any of her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estate. As the nuns walk in their sleep and see strange visions, Isolde is accused of witchcraftÃ¢â‚¬â€and Luca is sent to investigate her, but finds himself plotting her escape.\n.\nDespite their vows, despite themselves, love grows between Luca and Isolde as they travel across Europe with their faithful companions, Freize and Ishraq. The four young people encounter werewolves, alchemists, witches, and death-dancers as they head toward a real-life historical figure who holds the boundaries of Christendom and the secrets of the Order of the Dragon.\n.\nThe first in a series, this epic and richly detailed drama is grounded in historical communities and their mythic beliefs. It includes a medieval map of Europe that will track their journey; and the interior will include relevant decorative elements as well as an interior line illustration. And look for a QR code that links to a note from the author with additional, detailed information about the setting and the history that informed the writing. With Philippa GregoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark touch, this novel deftly brings the pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and its salacious scandalsÃ¢â‚¬â€vividly and disturbingly to life.\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
