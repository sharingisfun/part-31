Kings And Chandeliers \n2. Hills Like White Elephants \n3. Clush \n4. Empty Sighs &amp; Wine \n5. Oceans For Backyards \n6. Viola Lion\n7. Cemetery Weather\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIsles and Glaciers came together in Seattle in December of 2008, put their individual egos aside (which for some was considerable), and created a sound unlike any they had individually ever done before. The cohesion of the group, the sound and tone, is remarkable given their short stay recording with Casey Bates. Fans and newcomers will delight in the vocal gymnastics of Jonny, Vic and Craig - it's a competition to excel and the listener is the winner. This is a blend of musical expression that will unfortunately not be re-created again soon since all the members have gone on with their respective primary projects - but for slightly less than 27 minutes on seven tracks they realized heights that mainstream-label groups try for years to attain. Special kudos go out to Nick Martin and B (Brian) South (Southall) who took threads of ideas and tied them together in a cohesive and powerful way - showcasing each vocal member in a blend of texture and substance. It becomes a distinctive sound with personality and life - here's hoping that Seattle can capture and harness these remarkable artists again in the near future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4cf6b0e6dd675463001c4e3f48e47a7184a9346","amp;dn":"The+Hearts+of+Lonely+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4cf6b0e6dd675463001c4e3f48e47a7184a9346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,207,107,14,109,214,117,70,48,1,196,227,244,142,71,167,24,74,147,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
