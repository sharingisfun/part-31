Or you like to play flash games and would like to control volume level ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ IndieVolume can do that as well.\nTwo or more soundcards, but applications play only on one.\n\nFor example, if you have built-in sound card and SoundBlaster as second sound card, or USB/Bluetooth headset, you can configure certain applications play\non built-in sound card, and others play on SoundBlaster or USB headset, fully employing your audio hardware. \n\nMute all applications when critical application plays a sound.\n\nFor example, you are having business chat in Skype or GoogleTalk, and suddenly some application plays a sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with IndieVolume, you can mark Skype/GoogleTalk\nas &quot;exclusive&quot;, so none application would sound during your Skype/GoogleTalk calls. \nUgly sounds.\n\nIf you do not have SoundBlaster, you can enrich application sounds by applying fancy effects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ IndieVolume comes preconfigured with over 50 FX presets,\nsimilar to SoundBlaster ones; it is software replacement for SoundBlaster.\n\nPrize: $24.95  \n\nInstructions: Use serial provided (found inside serial.txt) to register.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00e9d13a307f6be81c3458356a693e701d1bda7","amp;dn":"Indie+Volume+3.3.79.146+%2B+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00e9d13a307f6be81c3458356a693e701d1bda7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,14,157,19,163,7,246,190,129,195,69,131,86,166,147,231,1,209,189,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
