We connect with  \n  friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out  \n  what's happening in the world. But with that same simple  \n  swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With  \n  each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our  \n  every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And  \n  it's not just people. Today, all major cities are  \n  networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and  \n  controlled by complex operating systems.  \n   \n  In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central  \n  Operating System (ctOS) - and it controls almost every  \n  piece of the city's technology and holds key information  \n  on all of the city's residents.  \n   \n  You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former  \n  thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family  \n  tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family,  \n  you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you  \n  by manipulating everything connected to the city's  \n  network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download  \n  personal information to locate a target, control traffic  \n  lights and public transportation to stop the enemy ... and  \n  more.  \n   \n  Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact  \n  your own style of revenge.  \n\n   \n  * See included url for more information on this games key  \n  features.  \n\n   \n  1) Extract TPTB-WDLC.001 using 7-Zip 9.20 or WinRAR.  \n   \n  2) Copy contents of  Update  folder to installed game directory  \n  overwriting all file (s)  \n   \n  3) Copy contents of  Crack  folder to installed game directory  \n  overwriting all file (s)  \n   \n  4) Copy contents of  Unlocker  to the following directory  \n  C:  ProgramData  Orbit  274  &lt;UserName&gt;  overwriting all file (s)  \n  as needed.  \n   \n  5) Play  \n \n   \n  More Info: http://watchdogs.ubi.com/watchdogs/en-us/home/  \n   \n   \n  Included DLC:  \n   \n  Season Pass \n  The Palace Pack  \n  Conspiracy! \n  Untouchables Pack  \n  Club Justice Pack \n  Exclusive Missions Pack  \n  Blume Agent Pack \n  Breakthrough Pack  \n  DedSec Shadow Pack \n  Signature Shot Pack  \n  Cyberpunk Pack  \n   \n   \n  This DLC Pack also contains additional Uplay Unlocks accessed  \n  in game via the Weapons Menu.
