He and the producer of his solo albums, John Alcock, compiled Odds &amp; Sods from various tapes. Two LPs of material were collected, but only one was released. Many of the album's songs were already heavily bootlegged.\n\nThe material from the second unreleased LP was later included on the 1998 remastered CD version.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c75565aa8cc473085dd83339c10c2f612249f424","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+%5C%27Odds+%26+Sods%5C%27+%5BExpanded+Edition%5D++%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c75565aa8cc473085dd83339c10c2f612249f424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,85,101,170,140,196,115,8,93,216,51,57,193,12,47,97,34,73,244,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
