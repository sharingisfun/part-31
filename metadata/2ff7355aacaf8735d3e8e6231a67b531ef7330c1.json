Angelica is a spellbinding Victorian ghost story, an intriguing literary and psychological puzzle, and a meditation on marriage, childhood, memory, and fear.\n\nThe novel opens in London, in the 1880s, with the Barton household on the brink of collapse. Mother, father, and daughter provoke one another, consciously and unconsciously, and a horrifying crisis is triggered. As the family's tragedy is told several times from different perspectives, events are recast and sympathies shift. \nIn the dark of night, a chilling sexual spectre is making its way through the house, hovering over the sleeping girl and terrorizing her fragile mother. Are these visions real, or is there something more sinister, and more human, to fear? A spiritualist is summoned to cleanse the place of its terrors, but with her arrival the complexities of motive and desire only multiply. The mother's failing health and the father's many secrets fuel the growing conflicts, while the daughter flirts dangerously with truth and fantasy.\n\nWhile Angelica is reminiscent of such classic horror tales as The Turn of the Screw and The Haunting of Hill House, it is also a thoroughly modern exploration of identity, reality, and love. Set at the dawn of psychoanalysis and the peak of spiritualism's acceptance, Angelica is also an evocative historical novel that explores the timeless human hunger for certainty. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Angelica, Arthur Phillip's spellbinding third book, cements this young novelist's reputation as one of the best writers in America, a storyteller who combines Nabokovian wit and subtlety with a narrative urgency that rivals Stephen King&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œWashington Post\n\nPrague, 2002\n\nPrague depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune Ãƒâ€˜ financial, romantic, and spiritual Ãƒâ€˜ in an exotic city newly opened to the West. They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague, where the atmospheric decay of post-Cold War Europe is even more cinematically perfect, have it better. Still, they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making. What they actually find is a deceptively beautiful place that they often fail to understand. What does it mean to fret about your fledgling career when the man across the table was tortured by two different regimes? How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?\nJournalist John Price finds these questions impossible to answer yet impossible to avoid, though he tries to forget them in the din of Budapest's nightclubs, in a romance with a secretive young diplomat, at the table of an elderly cocktail pianist, and in the moody company of a young man obsessed with nostalgia. Arriving in Budapest one spring day to pursue his elusive brother, John finds himself pursuing something else entirely, something he can't quite put a name to, something that will draw him into stories much larger than himself.\n\nThe Egyptologist, 2004\n\nFrom the bestselling author of Prague comes a witty, inventive, brilliantly constructed novel about an Egyptologist obsessed with finding the tomb of an apocryphal king. This darkly comic labyrinth of a story opens on the desert plains of Egypt in 1922, then winds its way from the slums of Australia to the ballrooms of Boston by way of Oxford, the battlefields of the First World War, and a royal court in turmoil. Just as Howard Carter unveils the tomb of Tutankhamun, making the most dazzling find in the history of archaeology, Oxford-educated Egyptologist Ralph Trili push is digging himself into trouble, having staked his professional reputation and his fiancee's fortune on a scrap of hieroglyphic pornography. Meanwhile, a relentless Australian detective sets off on the case of his career, spanning the globe in search of a murderer. And another murderer. And possibly another murderer. The confluence of these seemingly separate stories results in an explosive ending, at once inevitable and utterly unpredictable. Arthur Phillips leads this expedition to its unforgettable climax with all the wit and narrative bravado that made Prague one of the most critically acclaimed novels of 2002. Exploring issues of class, greed, ambition, and the very human hunger for eternal life, this staggering second novel gives us a glimpse of Phillips's range and maturity and is sure to earn him further acclaim as one of the most exciting authors of his generation.\n\nThe Song Is You, 2009\n\nEach song on JulianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iPod, Ã¢â‚¬Å“that greatest of all human inventions,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a touchstone. There are songs for the girls from when he was single, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one for the day he met his wife-to-be, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one for the day his son was born. But when JulianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family falls apart, even music loses its hold on him.\n\n    Until one snowy night in Brooklyn, when his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soundtrackÃ¢â‚¬â€and life itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€start to play again. Julian stumbles into a bar and sees Cait OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dwyer, a flame-haired Irish rock singer, performing with her band, and a strange and unlikely love affair is ignited. Over the next few months, Julian and CaitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion plays out, though they never meet. What follows is a heartbreaking dark comedy, the tenderest of love stories, and a perfectly observed tale of the way we live now.\n \n\nThe Tragedy of Arthur, 2011\n\nThe Tragedy of Arthur is an emotional and elaborately constructed tour de force from Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the best writers in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Washington Post). Its doomed hero is Arthur Phillips, a young novelist struggling with a con artist father who works wonders of deception. Imprisoned for decades and nearing the end of his life, Arthur's father reveals a treasure he's kept secret for half a century: The Tragedy of Arthur, a previously unknown play by William Shakespeare. Arthur and his twin sister inherit their father's mission: to see the manuscript published and acknowledged as the Bard's last great gift to humanity . . . unless it's their father's last great con. By turns hilarious and haunting, this virtuosic novel, which includes Shakespeare's (?) lost play in its entirety, brilliantly subverts our notions of truth, fiction, genius, and identity, as the two ArthursÃ¢â‚¬â€the novelist and the ancient kingÃ¢â‚¬â€play out their strangely intertwined fates.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillips&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe torrent contains all the above books by the author, in epub and PDF formats, including respective cover image.\nPlease Seed!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff7355aacaf8735d3e8e6231a67b531ef7330c1","amp;dn":"Arthur+Phillips+%285+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff7355aacaf8735d3e8e6231a67b531ef7330c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,247,53,90,172,175,135,53,211,232,230,35,26,103,181,49,239,115,48,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
