He \n\ndreams of a super-race, returning Serbia to its grand connections to ancient \n\nGreece. In his laboratory, assisted by Otto, he builds a desirable female body, \n\nbut needs a male who will be superbody and superlover. He thinks he has found just \n\nthe right brain to go with a body he's built, but he's made an error, taking the \n\nhead of a gay aesthete. Meanwhile, the Baroness has her lusts, and she fastens \n\non Nicholas, a friend of the dead lad. Can the Baron pull off his grand plan? He \n\nbrings the two zombies together to mate. \n\nMeanwhile, Nicholas tries to free his dead friend. What about the Baron's children?\n\n\nFEATURE #2\nBLOOD FOR DRACULA                             &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071233/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071233/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUdo Kier is without a doubt the sickliest of vampires in any director's \n\ninterpretation of the Bram Stoker tale. Count Dracula knows that if he fails to \n\ndrink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced &quot;wirgin's&quot;] blood, it's time \n\nto move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count \n\nand he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known  \n\nto be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search\n\nfor a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR \n\nvirgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not \n\nas pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to \n\nobserve strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count. \n\nIt's a race for Dracula to discover who's the real virgin, before he either dies \n\nfrom malnourishment or from the wooden stake of the Communist.\n\n                              DOUBLE FEATURE FEATURES\n\n You can just hit &quot;play&quot; to get the whole experience (trailers,adds,intermission) \n \nor just &quot;select title&quot; to see what you want.
