Winter 2011 saw the worst storm in 40 years hit the frigid Bering Sea. The crew of the salvage tug Redeemer battle freezing, 20 foot waves and hurricane force winds to rescue the latest stricken vessel before she is torn apart in the unforgiving icy waters. Waging their skill and endurance against the elements, the crew of the Arctic Wind take on the Sea in a mid-winter fishing season that could net almost $500,000 of Alaskan cod. The plummeting temperatures and 23 foot wave heights make this expedition a serious gamble.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866bfbf49d7babf3825a5acba668014df703e5c1","amp;dn":"Deadly+Seas+s01e01+The+Bering+Sea+HDTV-Killers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866bfbf49d7babf3825a5acba668014df703e5c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,107,251,244,157,123,171,243,130,90,90,203,166,104,1,77,247,3,229,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
