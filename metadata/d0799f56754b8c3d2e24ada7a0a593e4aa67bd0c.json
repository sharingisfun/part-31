Once she arrives, reality strikes hard and her mission to claim what is hers and fulfill her lifelong dream to &quot;return&quot; to Palestine is obstructed at every turn. Having  discovered that her grandfather's bank account was frozen and seized in 1948, she goes to the new Ramallah branch of the bank to claim the funds. Frustrated and deluded when her demands are rebuffed, she and her new Palestinian boyfriend Emad decide to take control of their own destinies by every means possible - even if it means breaking the law.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/le-sel-de-la-mer-salt-of-this-sea/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/le-sel-de-la-mer-salt-of-this-sea/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_of_this_Sea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_of_this_Sea&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1090680/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1090680/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVery moving award-winning Palestinian film from 2008 directed by Annemarie Jacir.In Arabic with English subtitles\n\n\nAwards\nFIPRESCI PRIZE - INTERNATIONAL CRITICS AWARD\n\nInternational Federation of Film Critics, 2008\nFIRST PRIZE - BEST FILM\n\nSguardi Altrove Film Festival, Italy 2009\nSPECIAL JURY PRIZE\n\nOsians Asian &amp; Arab Film Festival, 2008\nBEST FIRST FILM\n\nTraverse City Film Festival, 2009\nSPECIAL JURY PRIZE\n\nOran International Festival of Arab Cinema, 2009\nRANDA CHAHAL PRIZE\n\nJournÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©es cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©matographiques de Carthage, 2008\nBEST SCREENPLAY\n\nDubai International Film Festival, 2008\nBEST OF FEST SELECT\n\nMinneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival 2009\nAUDIENCE CHOICE AWARD\n\nHouston Palestine Film Festival, 2009\nAUDIENCE CHOICE AWARD - BEST FEATURE\n\nChicago Palestine Film Festival, 2009\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nCairo Refugee Film Festival, 2009\nAUDIENCE CHOICE RUNNER UP\n\nToronto Palestine Film Festival, 2008\nPALESTINE'S OFFICIAL OSCAR ENTRY\n\nFOR BEST FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILM, 2008\nSOPADIN FINALIST\n\nGrand Prix Best Screenplay, 2007\nCINEMA IN MOTION AWARDS\n\nSan Sebastian Film Festival, 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0799f56754b8c3d2e24ada7a0a593e4aa67bd0c","amp;dn":"Milh+Hadha+al-Bahr+%28Salt+of+this+Sea%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0799f56754b8c3d2e24ada7a0a593e4aa67bd0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,121,159,86,117,75,140,61,46,36,173,167,160,165,147,228,170,103,189,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
