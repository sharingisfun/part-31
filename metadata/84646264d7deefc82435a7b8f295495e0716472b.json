Spanning decades with only a few points of obscure intersections, the occasions on which the two styles have met and crossed into the pop culture lexicon have often yielded a contrary, oil-and-water form. The abstract nature of the &quot;ambient&quot; genre and instant gratification of the &quot;pop&quot; song require deft hands for successful cohabitation, thus it's little wonder that there are so few practitioners of its delicate equilibrium.\nOrcas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ comprised of haze-pop auteur BenoÃƒÂ®t Pioulard and post-minimalist composer Rafael Anton Irisarri Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is an imaginative return to that narrative. \n\nReleased April 13, 2012; 320 kbps quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84646264d7deefc82435a7b8f295495e0716472b","amp;dn":"Orcas+%5B2012%5D+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84646264d7deefc82435a7b8f295495e0716472b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,100,98,100,215,222,239,200,36,53,167,184,242,149,73,94,7,22,71,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
