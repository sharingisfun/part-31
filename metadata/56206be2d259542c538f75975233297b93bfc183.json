The reason I made this was to provide an easy and reliable way to search and research the Bible utilizing a version (New Living Translation) that uses regular day to day English. The best way IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve found to search in Acrobat is to use advanced search option (more about this below or check your help file) I also made sure that the Acrobat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRead out loudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ worked. I found that the voice of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the most naturally sounding voices out there. Just install it and Acrobat should automatically start using it. I believe it cost about 30 but you can D/L it (it might be a trial version) here on Bit Torrent. I searched near and far for a good version of this Bible in electronic form; I looked on eBay, CBN, book stores, everywhere but just couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find what I set out for. So I decide since I already had a few books under my belt that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve converted to electronic form I though why not ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only a little over 800 pages ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚ï¿½Ã…Â  yes I spent a few days on this project trying to get it as good as I could with the equipment I have (Canon Pixma MP530) This electronic Bible is useful in many cases. Like actually right when I got done with it, I was watching the BIO channel and someone said that there was a verse in the bible that said something. Well I went to work right away and typed a few search words to see if I could find what he was talking about but of course out of over 600 hits in the bible none of them panned out, but I did it very quick much quicker than if I tried to look online. But perhaps he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wrong itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possible it was worded differently in say the King James Version. Well, enjoy the power of being able to disprove or learning to how to live a new life through the power of Jesus Christ!! Please read also the all the introductions to this Bible too. God Bless!!!!
