Chelsea waved goodbye to manager Rafael Benitez by securing Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win over Everton last May. The two sides meet again at Stamford Bridge, with Champions League football again on the top of both sides' priorities list. Elsewhere, title contenders Arsenal and Manchester City are both in home action against Sunderland and Stoke respectively. City put three past Stoke at the Etihad Stadium last season and, given their freescoring campaign this time round, they are looking for more goals in this match. There is a crucial game at the foot of the table with Cardiff taking on Hull, while West Brom meet Fulham and West Ham entertain Southampton. In the late kick-off, David Moyes takes his mis-firing Manchester United side to a revitalised Crystal Palace.\n\nNotes\nCaptured and encoded at 50fps, which as you will see gives much more fluid and smoother movement. Done for my friend in New Zealand but I thought I would share it with you guys.
