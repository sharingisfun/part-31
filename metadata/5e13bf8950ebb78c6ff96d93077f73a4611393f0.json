Needing some time away from the city, Jake, his wife Kim, and their son Miles head to upstate New York to take in the winter sights, though the drive up is hardly relaxing for any of them. George accidentally hits and severely injures a deer that ran onto the icy road; after George stops to inspect the damage, he's confronted by an angry local named Otis who flies into a rage, telling George that he and his fellow hunters had been tracking the deer for some time. An argument breaks out, which leaves George feeling deeply shaken. When George and Kim arrive at their cabin, they discover that it's next door to Otis' property, and they soon find that a dark and intimidating presence seems to have taken over the cottage. Since, when they stopped at a store en route to the cabin, a shopkeeper told Miles about the legend of the Wendigo, a beast from Indian folklore who is half-man, half-deer, and can change itself at will, the child begins to wonder if the creature might have something to do with his family's sudden misfortune.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTechnical info:\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Z:\\SEEDZOR\\WENDIGO_SCN.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 111 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate                         : 982 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.136\nStream size                      : 619 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 116 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 72.9 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 563 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : ABR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e13bf8950ebb78c6ff96d93077f73a4611393f0","amp;dn":"%5BReq%5D+Wendigo+%5B2001%5D%5BXVID%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e13bf8950ebb78c6ff96d93077f73a4611393f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,19,191,137,80,235,183,140,111,249,109,147,7,127,115,164,97,19,147,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
