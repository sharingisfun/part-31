A notorious safe-breaker before the war, Chapman duped the Germans so successfully that he was awarded their highest decoration, the Iron Cross. He remains the only British citizen ever to win one.\n\nIncluding remarkable and newly discovered footage from an interview Chapman gave three years before his death in 1997, the programme goes on the trail of one of Britain's most unlikely heroes - a story of adventure, love, intrigue and astonishing courage.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a37b8b9470b0568a7fa78d349d0bd1e6ded6cda","amp;dn":"Double+Agent%3A+The+Eddie+Chapman+Story++%28BBC+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a37b8b9470b0568a7fa78d349d0bd1e6ded6cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,55,184,185,71,11,5,104,167,250,120,211,73,208,189,30,109,237,108,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
