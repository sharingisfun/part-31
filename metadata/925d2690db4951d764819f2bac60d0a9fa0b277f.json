His first day on the job, Mackelway\ninvestigates the murder of a traveling salesman Harold Speck,\nwhich turns out to be the first of three seemingly random\nkillings. Or perhaps they are not random at all; the last to\ndie is Mackelway's nemesis, Raymond Starkey. The assignment\nconsumes him. His past mistakes haunt him. His head throbs\nconstantly as he tries to find the link between the victims\nthat will lead him to their killer. The case becomes\nincreasingly gruesome and patently personal. This does not\ngo unnoticed by his unflappable partner Fran Kulok, who knows\nof Mackelway's past and the demons that afflict him. Like\nMackelway, she becomes drawn into the labyrinth of chilling\nclues, all of which point to the enigmatic Benjamin O'Ryan.\nO'Ryan clearly has a connection to the murders, a connection\nhe flaunts; quite possibly, he may also harbor a sinister\nlink to Mackelway.\n\nUser Comments : Stylish Serial-Killer Movie\n\nBudget: $27,000,000 (estimated)\n\nOpening Weekend $3,446,375 (USA) (29 August 2004) (1,500 Screens)\n\nMovie Name : Suspect Zero\n\nRelease Date : 16 March 2005\n\nTheatre Date : 29 August 2004\n\nDVD Date : March 22 2005\n\nCDInfo : 1CD/mp3/XViD WS\n\nRuntime : 99mins\n\nRating : 5.7/10 (421 votes)\n\nAaron Eckhart ...
