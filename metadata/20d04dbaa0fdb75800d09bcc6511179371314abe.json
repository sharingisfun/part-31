All you need to install on your PC is a free VMware Player for your operation system, available for Windows, Linux and MAC!\r\n\r\nThe image file contains Debian 8 64 bit with Gnome minimal, VM Tools, Firefox, Chrome, the real Oracle Java JRE and Android SDK, Node server with NPM, Angular, Ionic and Bower, Sublime Text Editor and much more... no hassle with installing on Linux ;)\r\n\r\nWith some additionally tools already installed, also a classic Windows user should be able to handle this.\r\n\r\nKNOWN RESTRICTIONS: the Android emulator does not run in the virtual environment (yet?). You still can use your smart phone or the browser preview for testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the story behind?\r\nI got sick of all these different installations for various projects and online courses, messing with each other and my system. Now for each new project I just clone a new VM and everything is running smoothly :)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nAfter you installed the VMware Player (or Workstation), extract the tar.gz file and open the vmdk file in it. Check the settings (CPU, RAM) according to you your PC. \r\nStart the VM. Password (also for root) is: changeme\r\n\r\nHave fun and SEED!\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact me for bugs, requests and so on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d04dbaa0fdb75800d09bcc6511179371314abe","amp;dn":"Ionic+App+Development+Platform+on+Debian+8+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d04dbaa0fdb75800d09bcc6511179371314abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,208,77,186,160,253,183,88,0,208,155,204,101,17,23,147,113,49,74,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
