The celebrity panel show hosted by me Keith Lemon featuring the fittest team captains known to man, Holly Willoughbooby and Fearne Cotton with me old mate Rufus Hound. All't best bits from series 1 to 3 where we all look youngerer apart from Fearne who's always looked like an old lady (only joking she's super F.A.F). Travel back in time to when it first started with appearances from John Bishop, Emma Bunton, Dermot O'Leary, Davina McCall, Paddy McGuiness and my 2 Irish offspring Jedward potato! With 'nuff unseen stuff that was never aired cos I said things I shouldn't, outakes, and all those other extra fings you get on a DVD which stands for Digital Versatile Disc. Laugh until ya stop. Mot, mot, mot. All't best, Keith Lemon.
