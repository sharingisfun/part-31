It also features Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy and Dave Murray of Iron Maiden as guest guitarists.\n\nWELCOME TO THE WORLD\n\n    01. &quot;The Last Chain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04 (Smith/Makin)\n    02. &quot;A Quarter to Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22 (Smith/Makin)\n    03. &quot;Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 (Smith)\n    04. &quot;Believe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 (Smith/Makin)\n    05. &quot;With You Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 (Smith/Makin)\n    06. &quot;Into the Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57 (Smith/Makin)\n    07. &quot;No Loss to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20 (Smith/Makin)\n    08. &quot;Underground&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26 (Smith)\n    09. &quot;Welcome to the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46 (Smith)\n    10. &quot;Something Real&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42 (Smith/Makin)\n    11. &quot;Innocence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23 (Sturgis)\n    12. &quot;I'm Alive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33 (Smith/Makin)\n\n     * Adrian Smith (guitar,backing vocals)\n     * Andy Makin (vocal)\n     * Gary Leideman (bass guitar)\n     * Mike Sturgis (drums)\n     * Richard Cottle (keyboards)\n     * Martin Ditcham (percussion)\n     * Dave Murray (guitars on track 5)\n     * Scott Gorham (guitars on track 12)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the release of Welcome To The World, Adrian went to help on two albums and two tours with Bruce Dickinson which were both highly successful. After this, both Adrian and Bruce re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999 and Adrian split up Psycho Motel. When asked if he would consider re-forming the band in 2001, he said that they had &quot;no plans at the moment&quot; but they would &quot;possibly do some stuff next year&quot;. This has yet to happen with his continued success with Iron Maiden.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e298fe712517213761c63b4053a40780f5d3388","amp;dn":"Psycho+Motel+-+2CD+Discography+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e298fe712517213761c63b4053a40780f5d3388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,41,143,231,18,81,114,19,118,28,99,180,5,58,64,120,15,93,51,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
