Just when things seem bad, her dancing saves the day. This is also a gangster film, so many plot twists follow.\n\nThis is OTT melodrama which should appeal to appeal to people who liked Black Swan. I thought NS was better in Victimas del Pecado, since I prefer Cuban Mexico, but this has a more complicated plot.\n\nMexico was the world centre of Spanish cinema back then - Spain was in disarray, and South America was less technically advanced. Bunuel made some of his best films there then.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfec97e59b76568b3eb527d043b8028289d46d0f","amp;dn":"Aventurera+%281950%29+Ninon+Sevilla+Rumbera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfec97e59b76568b3eb527d043b8028289d46d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,236,151,229,155,118,86,139,62,181,39,208,67,184,2,130,137,212,109,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
