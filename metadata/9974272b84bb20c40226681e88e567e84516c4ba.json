Things happen fast in Dungeon Raid, so gather your courage and dive in!\n\nDungeon Raid is a puzzle RPG, a blend of puzzle game with roleplaying mechanics. Your mission is to trace a path through a set of matching tiles, but watch out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you may be attacked by enemies who improve as fast as you do.\n\nAs you go, the object is to collect as many resources as you can, like gold and experience. Get enough points and you can buy or upgrade equipment and level up. All the while, remember to avoid those nasty enemy skull tiles and fight them off for as long as you possibly can. And don't get too greedy, or you risk being overwhelmed!\n\nThe higher you go in a Dungeon Raid game, the more strategy youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to need to match a greater number of tiles, grab bonuses and stay ahead of those evil adversaries.

As you level up, there are many trade offs to consider and complimentary combinations of skills to be chosen.
