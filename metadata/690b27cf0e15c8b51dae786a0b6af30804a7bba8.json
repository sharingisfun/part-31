This compilation offers an excellent representation of the sprawling, multifaceted 2004 hip-hop scene. From some of the biggest crossover hits--Juvenile's naturally chopped-and-screwed &quot;Slow Motion&quot; and Petey Pablo's club jam &quot;Freek-a-Leek&quot;--to the underground pop of Slum Village's &quot;Selfish&quot; to the expert rhymes of Mobb Deep's &quot;Got It Twisted,&quot; The Source celebrates hip-hop's diversity. The magazine wisely tips its collective cap to the R&amp;B link in the rap chain with newcomer Akon's otherworldly ballad &quot;Locked Out,&quot; which immediately follows one of the more frenetically flashy singles of the year, Lil' Flip's &quot;Game Over.&quot; The Source's collections are always fascinating and entertaining, and VOL. 9 is one of its best.\n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n1.
