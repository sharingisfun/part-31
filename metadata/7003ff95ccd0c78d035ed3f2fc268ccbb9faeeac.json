It's the kind of thing you watch, late at night, when you're\nnot too fussy, and the only other movie playing is &quot;Terminator&quot;, which you've\nalready seen 27 times. There seems to be an entire movie industry built on these\nlow-budget made-for-TV potboilers. But wait. The writers threw a wrench into\nthis one. Jack, Jenny and Andrew are out camping. Jack and Jenny (I know, I\nknow, those names) are an item. Andrew is the fifth wheel. Andrew is gay. Enter\nKevin, a hot guy with a cute butt. Kevin is a hermit living in a tent, nearby,\nwith his chemistry set. Kevin is also gay. Do you see where this is going? Will\nthey or won't they? Anyway, bad things happen but Kevin and Andrew save the day.\nThey kiss just before the final fade-out. It's good to see a gay romantic\nsubplot in a project such as this, even if it's presented in a rather chaste\nmanner. Otherwise, this is strictly generic fare - filler for cable movie\nchannels and a hook on which to hang commercials.\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5f3c3e2f6b2b291f38323e3633713c3032&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7003ff95ccd0c78d035ed3f2fc268ccbb9faeeac","amp;dn":"Black.Rain.2009.HDTV.XviD-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7003ff95ccd0c78d035ed3f2fc268ccbb9faeeac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,3,255,149,204,208,199,141,3,94,211,242,252,38,140,203,185,250,238,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
