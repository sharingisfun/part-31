No\r\nregenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just\r\nyou, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing the weapons of fallen enemies to\r\nshoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\r\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and\r\ndisruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT's polished, minimalist visual\r\nlanguage helps you concentrate on the most important - on the fluidity of\r\ngameplay and the cinematic beauty of destruction.\r\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and\r\ndesign. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a\r\nhugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and\r\nnominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by it's\r\nindependant, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n-Install\r\n-Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b54e4552d57892f0f5b962fdaef32ed6e2b3aec","amp;dn":"SUPERHOT-GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b54e4552d57892f0f5b962fdaef32ed6e2b3aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,84,228,85,45,87,137,47,15,91,150,47,218,239,50,237,110,43,58,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
