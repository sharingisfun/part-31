This is a drumming instructional video about 4-way independence.  I can't find any information on this guy or the video.  He introduces himself at the beginning, and I may or may not have heard and spelled it correctly.  Then at the end he calls it the Ballistic Independence video, that's all I know.  It's a cool video, not very good quality but still I'd say worth having.  Audio is pretty quiet, you have to turn up the volume.  If you have any information on this guy or the video, please leave a comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863462b15e8dd4c1b9bd698cf9eb94927e62e8ee","amp;dn":"Joe+Stizek+-+Ballistic+Independence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863462b15e8dd4c1b9bd698cf9eb94927e62e8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,52,98,177,94,141,212,193,185,189,105,140,249,235,148,146,126,98,232,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
