In this ebook we tried to collect the 50 most interesting sights for you. Of course the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building or the Times Square must be seen once you are in New York. However, in this collection we tried to concentrate on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“secret jewelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the city, on places which are not overcrowded by tourists or sometimes unknown even for the locals. So you will learn about the Snug Harbor on the Staten Island; we will present you the only one you-name-the-price company which offers free walking, bus, bike and food tours around various neighborhoods. You will learn about historical bars like the Stonewall Inn, get to know lots of other bars, and the best places to dance the night away. We will also present you several wellness/fitness centers where you can recharge your batteries. And, of course, we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget about shopping. New York has lots to offer and whether you are looking for electronics, jewelry, fashion, book or food, you will find some good ideas in our book.\nMillions of books have been already written about New York City. Neither of them can replace experience. The best way to get to know a new place is by going there, starting conversations with the locals and always keeping your mind and eyes open. We wish you a pleasant stay in New York!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a3dcebd617a58f1ce63c9c12e9d02defa4ac11","amp;dn":"The+New+York+City+Bucket+List++-+Epub+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a3dcebd617a58f1ce63c9c12e9d02defa4ac11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,163,220,235,214,23,165,143,28,230,60,156,18,233,208,45,239,164,172,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
