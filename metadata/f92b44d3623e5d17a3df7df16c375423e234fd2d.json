The song was released as the band's first single from their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not after being signed to Domino Records. It debuted at Number One on the UK Singles Chart on 23 October 2005, and remains one of their best known songs. It was the first of two UK Number 1 singles for the band. They performed the track at the Opening Ceremony of The London 2012 Olympics.\n\nReleased on 17 October 2005, it rode the wave of popularity behind the band after a series of sell-out gigs across the country, culminating with a gig in front of 2,000 people at the London Astoria. It debuted at Number One on the UK Singles Chart on 23 October. The release of the song and its rise to number one further increased the ever-growing hype surrounding the band, and it was two weeks before they reached the cover of NME magazine. The single was released during a sell-out UK tour, although the band were playing at significantly smaller venues to those at which they would perform only months later.\n\nIn May 2007, NME magazine placed &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot; at number 10 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\nIn October 2011, NME placed it at number 11 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;.\n\nThe video is a live recording of the band playing the song in a studio with a small audience watching with both the video and audio taken live. The video was shot using television cameras from the 1970s to give it a more aged effect. American band The Strokes had previously made a similar music video for their single &quot;Last Nite&quot;, Arctic Monkeys are known to be fans of The Strokes.\n\nArctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.\n\nThe band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Elastica's self-titled album and remains the fastest-selling debut album by a group in the UK. The band have won five Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Group twice, and have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards. The band also won the Mercury Prize for their debut album, in addition to receiving two nominations in 2007 and 2013.\n\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Bet_You_Look_Good_on_the_Dancefloor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Bet_You_Look_Good_on_the_Dancefloor&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAdipAafG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAdipAafG&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9200kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Digital Audio 48000Hz stereo 320kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:53\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
