His &quot;Big Bop Noveau&quot; band consists of four trumpets, trombonist Tom Garling (who takes a rockish guitar solo on &quot;Birdland&quot;), Matt Wallace and Chris Farr on saxophones, and a rhythm section. With the exception of &quot;Birdland,&quot; the music is strictly bebop, with plenty of screaming trumpet and heated playing; Wallace's alto outbursts often take honors. Highlights include &quot;Manteca,&quot; &quot;Cajun Cookin',&quot; &quot;Milestones&quot; and a hyper &quot;It Don't Mean a Thing.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrackl list:\n01 - You Got It\n02 - Manteca\n03 - The Vibe\n04 - Cajun Cookin`\n05 - Milestones\n06 - She Was Too Good To Me\n07 - Birdland \n08 - Blues From Around Here\n09 - It Don't Mean A Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing\n\nPersonnel:\nMaynard Ferguson trumpet, plus flugelhorn on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Vibe&quot;\nScott Englebright lead trumpet\nCarl Fischer trumpet\nLarry Foyen trumpet\nTom Garling trombone, guitar on Ã¢â‚¬Å“BirdlandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMatt Wallace tenor &amp; alto saxophones, vocal on Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Was Too Good To MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nChris Farr tenor &amp; soprano saxophones\nMarko Marcinko drums, plus percussion on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cajun Cookin'Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDan Zank piano &amp; keyboards\nPhil Palombi acoustic bass &amp; bass guitar\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ff691c2553d8fd292f98376bd63f059cf0a760","amp;dn":"Maynard+Ferguson+%26amp%3B+Big+Bop+Noveau+-+1996+-+One+More+Trip+To+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ff691c2553d8fd292f98376bd63f059cf0a760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,255,105,28,37,83,216,253,41,47,152,55,107,214,63,5,156,240,167,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
