It was recorded on November 11 and November 12 of 2012 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The November shows were advertised as the final Jack's Mannequin shows ever as Andrew McMahon decided to close the chapter on his moniker and reboot his career as a solo artist. The shows coincided with the 3rd annual benefit for the Dear Jack Foundation, McMahon's charitable organization that raises awareness for young adult cancer. All profits from the album went to benefit the foundation.\n\nThe concert film features 14 songs taken from two nights at the El Rey Theatre, and on the DVD are woven together with interview footage of Andrew chronicling seven years of living, writing, recording and touring as Jack's Mannequin. The bonus portion of the DVD includes 9 performance-only cuts as well.\n\nThe Mixed Tape\nRelease Me\nCrashin'\nHoliday From Real\nBruised\nSwim\nBloodshot\nAmy, I\nHammers and Strings (A Lullaby)\nDark Blue\nThe Resolution\nRestless Dream\nMFEO\nLa La Lie\n\nThis copy was ripped using DVD Decrypter in IFO mode, then converted to AppleTV 3 format using Handbrake. Should work on iPods and iPads as well. VLC should definitely be able to play it too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c91e73bf357a16e42619b15549a93c44e233faa","amp;dn":"Jack%27s+Mannequin+-+Live+from+the+El+Rey+Theatre+%5BAppleTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c91e73bf357a16e42619b15549a93c44e233faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,145,231,59,243,87,161,110,66,97,155,21,84,154,147,196,78,35,63,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
