It contains in the same \nMatroska file the original english track, a spanish-dub audio track, and two \nsubtitles (spanish and english) selectable during playback.\n\nYou need H.263 and AAC codecs to play this file.  I recommend using VLC Media\nPlayer, as it uses its own codecs.\n\nESP: Este es mi propio rip del DVD espaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol.  Contiene en el mismo archivo \nMatroska la pista de audio original en ingles, el doblaje en espaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol y\nsubtitulos en espaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol e ingles, todos intercambiables durante la reproduccion.\n\nEs necesario tener instalados los codecs H.263 y AAC para reproducirlo.\nRecomiendo usar el VLC Media Player, pues ya los trae incluidos.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Release Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n\nAlec Leamas, a British spy is sent to East Germany supposedly to defect, but in\n fact to sow disinformation. As more plot turns appear, Leamas becomes more \nconvinced that his own people see him as just a cog. His struggle back from \ndehumanization becomes the final focus of the story.  Written by John Vogel\n\nWhen a fellow British agent is killed at Checkpoint Charlie right before his \neyes, Alec Lemas, head of the Berlin station, returns to London headquarters. \nThere his boss, Control, inquires if he is tired, burnt out, ready to come in \nfrom the cold. Control suggests that there is a vacancy, a desk job, that might \ninterest him, but Alec declines adamantly. Thus, Control immediately mentions \nthat he has something out of the ordinary in mind for a man called Hans-Dieter \nMundt, who in 1959 posted as a member of an East German steel mission. Written \nby alfiehitchie \n\n\n\nTRIVIA\n\n\n When Richard Burton became a superstar, he insisted on casting his friends \nfrom his days at the Old Vic and West End (London&amp;#039;s equivalent of Broadway). \nThat is why Claire Bloom, who is clearly too old to be a teenager, was cast as \nNan Perry. Other friends of Burton&amp;#039;s cast in the film included the great stage \nactor Sir Michael Hordern and Robert Hardy.\n\n Richard Burton and co-star &amp;#039;Warren Mitchell&amp;#039; were Royal Air Force cadets \ntogether at Oxford in 1944, where they knew one another and became friends. \nFrom 1944-47, when both were demobilized, they were stationed together at \ntimes in Canada and back in England.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Personal Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy releases so far... personal rips from original DVDs, looking for quality...\nThey&amp;#039;re uploaded in TPB, Mininova and TorrentBox, but feel free to share them\non edonkey networks on any way you want.
