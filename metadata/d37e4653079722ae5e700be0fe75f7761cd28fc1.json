His platinum hit Read All About It and songs such as Goodnight have given fans a glimpse into this tragic story. But now for the first time Stephen discovers what really happened to his dad. Opening up to close family for the first time about his estrangement from his father, reconnecting with old relatives, meeting others affected by suicide and laying bare his own demons, Stephen faces tough answers.\r\nThrough this journey, Stephen explores the wider scourge of male suicide in the UK. As the biggest single killer of men under 45, latest figures show suicide accounts for nearly 5,000 male deaths a year in the UK. By understanding the complex factors behind it, the stigma around it and some of the ways it is being tackled, Stephen highlights the urgency of addressing this most pressing of problems.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Professor-Green-Suicide-and-Me-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2185Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 56 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 941 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06mvx4j","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d37e4653079722ae5e700be0fe75f7761cd28fc1","amp;dn":"BBC+Professor+Green+Suicide+and+Me+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d37e4653079722ae5e700be0fe75f7761cd28fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,126,70,83,7,151,34,174,94,112,11,224,254,117,247,118,28,210,143,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
