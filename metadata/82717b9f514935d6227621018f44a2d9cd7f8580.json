The program uses byte-by-byte comparison to locate identical files within the specified folders on your hard drive. You can further narrow the results by requiring the name and/or file size to be identical as well. The results are presented in a grouped and color coded list from where you can preview and then copy, move or delete some or all of the found duplicates. Vistanita Duplicate Finder also supports search for duplicate MP3 files by tag and finding of duplicate images based on visual similarities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82717b9f514935d6227621018f44a2d9cd7f8580","amp;dn":"Vistanita+Duplicate+Finder+v3.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82717b9f514935d6227621018f44a2d9cd7f8580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,113,123,159,81,73,53,214,34,118,33,1,143,68,162,217,205,127,133,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
