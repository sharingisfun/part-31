After CBS ended the Crimetime experiment in 1993, the series ran exclusively on USA. The show was created by Stephen J. Cannell.\n\nPortraying the daily lives of two detectives who solved sexually-based crimes of passion (&quot;silk stalkings&quot;) among the ultra-rich people of Palm Beach, Florida, the tightly-budgeted Silk Stalkings was not actually filmed in Florida. Most episodes were shot in San Diego, California. Some shows were filmed in Scottsdale, Arizona\n\nFrom 1991-1995, the lead characters were played by Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture, as detectives Christopher Lorenzo and Rita Lee Lance, respectively. Early in the series, Ben Vereen played a strong supporting character as Chris and Rita&amp;#039;s boss Captain Hutchinson (&quot;Hutch&quot;). Vereen was compelled to retire from the show during the second season due to an off-screen accident. Chris and Rita&amp;#039;s new boss, who would stay with the show for its duration, was Charlie Brill as Captain Harry Lipschitz. Brill&amp;#039;s real-life wife Mitzi McCall played Lipschitz&amp;#039;s free-spirited wife Frannie on the series, and the two provided some occasional comic relief amidst the dramatic tension of the storylines. Various recurring characters came and went, notably Dennis Paladino as a mob boss named Donnie &quot;Dogs&quot; DiBarto, John Byner as Cotton Dunn, a con artist and Scott Atkins as Officer Perry, a rookie cop. --&gt; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Stalkings \n\n22 EPISODES --&gt; 7,52 GB\n\nSeason 2 contains 23 episodes but on Torrent sites the first 2 episode of Season 2 are the last 2 on season 1.
