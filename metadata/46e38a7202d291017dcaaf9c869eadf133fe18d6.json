Indeed, the Bronze Age Aegean was a distant memory even to the original audience for this great work.\n\nYet the grandeur and immediacy of the Homeric world seem to defy time and space.\n\nHe depicts a legendary era in brilliant, unforgettable hues.\nHe peoples it with towering heroes who thirst for honor, fight shattering wars, and deal face-to-face with gods.\nHe acts out, in words memorized and passed on verbally long before they were ever set to paper, mankind's awesome passions for glory, love, and vengeance.\nAn Inquiry into Timeless Human Issues\nOr perhaps age seems only to burnish the luster of the Iliad precisely because of its very strangeness and distance, which throw so sharply into focus the timeless human issues it raises.\n\nThese issues are evoked by the power of a single dramatic question: Why does Achilles rage?\n\nAround these questions Homer weaves a narrative that makes us ask many questions:\n\nWhat are the limits of our freedom?\nWho or what shapes our actions and our ends?\nIs there a common humanity that we share, or is life only &quot;a constant seeking of power after power&quot;?\nWhat holds people together and keeps them going in extreme situations such as war?\nWhy do we love our own so strongly?\nWhere is the line between justice and revenge?\nAnd above all, what does it mean to be alive?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e38a7202d291017dcaaf9c869eadf133fe18d6","amp;dn":"TTC+Iliad+fo+Homer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e38a7202d291017dcaaf9c869eadf133fe18d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,227,138,114,2,210,145,1,125,202,175,156,134,158,173,241,51,254,24,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
