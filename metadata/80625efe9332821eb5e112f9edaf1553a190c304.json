The suicide attempt led to her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ divorce, and David all but vanished from EdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. Since childhood, she has heard from him only rarely, just enough to know heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been living on the streets and struggling with mental illness. But lately, there has been no word at all.\nNow in her thirties, Eden decides to go look for her father, so she can forgive him at last, and finally move forward. When her search uncovers other painful truthsÃ¢â‚¬â€not only the secrets her mother has kept from her, but also the agonizing question of whether David, after all these years, even wants to be foundÃ¢â‚¬â€Eden is forced to decide just how far sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll go in the name of love.\n\nBest Kept Secret\n\nCadence didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sit down one night and decide that downing two bottles of wine was a brilliant idea.\n\nHer drinking snuck up on her - as a way to sleep, to help her relax after a long day, to relieve some of the stress of the painful divorce thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left her struggling to make ends meet with her five-year old son, Charlie.\n\nIt wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always like this. Just a few years ago, Cadence seemed to have it allÃ¢â‚¬â€a successful husband, an adorable son, and a promising career as a freelance journalist. But with the demise of her marriage, her carefully constructed life begins to spiral out of control. Suddenly she is all alone trying to juggle the demands of work and motherhood.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80625efe9332821eb5e112f9edaf1553a190c304","amp;dn":"Amy+Hatvany+PACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80625efe9332821eb5e112f9edaf1553a190c304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,98,94,254,147,50,130,30,181,225,18,249,237,175,21,83,161,144,195,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
