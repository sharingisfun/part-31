Always a one-click-away companion dedicated to speeding up the design process, ADT works almost by stealth whether using Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, QuarkXpress, Dreamweaver or any tool to create digital media and websites. No more cluttering your desk or desktop with stickies, swatch books, calculators and google searches. ADT provides all of the obscure calculations and information designers need on a daily basis.\n\nUse its ruler to measure objects on-screen, quickly scan through font previews with your mouse's scrollwheel, search through thousands of PantoneÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® swatches to find the right color, sample pixels, retrieve color information, find characters and html entities, calculate percentages for image scaling and much more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ee807e30c60e5e41ff5ef2aa5710fde5bf60a0","amp;dn":"Art+Directors+Toolkit+5.2+%28v.130%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ee807e30c60e5e41ff5ef2aa5710fde5bf60a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,238,128,126,48,198,14,94,65,255,94,242,170,87,16,253,229,191,96,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
