The Oxcars bring down a monopoly.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Spoken lenguage: Spanish\n&gt;&gt;Texted lenguage: English\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Abstract:\n\nBarcelona, for one exhilarating night is the World Capital of Shared Culture. Artists and performers from all areas of Spanish and international culture take part in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“GalaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with all kind of surprises, pooling their efforts to demand a stop to culture being treated as merchandise by royalty management organisations and cultural industry lobbies. Artists say Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not in my nameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the commercialisation of culture, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not in my nameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to limiting the potential of digital media and to criminalization of the Internet. Civil society demands the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlost profitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of all the knowledge that is being withheld and stolen from public use in the name of private profits and asks for a free development of new sustainable models for creation and distribution of culture.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a758dc9550e49834f15c1a0c56bd84f6f8da6e50","amp;dn":"The+best+of+the+oXcars+2008-2011+%5BEng+subt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a758dc9550e49834f15c1a0c56bd84f6f8da6e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,88,220,149,80,228,152,52,241,92,26,12,86,189,132,246,248,218,110,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
