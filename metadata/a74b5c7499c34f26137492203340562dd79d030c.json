Its members were all from San Diego, California, United States, but they all lived and performed mainly in the United Kingdom and across Europe.\nThe band consisted of three members, Robin Proper-Sheppard (born Gary Sheppard) (guitar/vocals), Jimmy Fernandez (bass) and Ronald Austin (drums), and they first performed officially under the name The God Machine in 1991. They released an EP, Purity with the Eve record label, and were later given a recording contract with Fiction Records. They released two albums in their career, both with their trademark dark and industrial-sounding alternative rock, before Fernandez suddenly died from a cancerous brain tumour. Their single release of &quot;Home&quot;, peaked at No. 65 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1993.[1] Proper-Sheppard went on to form The Flower Shop Recordings label, and bands Sophia and The May Queens.\nTheir second album, One Last Laugh in a Place of Dying, was recognized by Alternative Press as one of the &quot;90 greatest albums of the 90s&quot; (#88) in their December 1998 issue.[citation needed]\nTheir earlier San Diego incarnation was called Society Line, and also featured guitarist Albert Amman, who left the band before its move to London.\n\n\n\nScenes from the Second Storey is the debut album by The God Machine released in 1993 by Fiction Records / Polydor. It peaked at #55 in the UK Album Chart.\nThe album opens with a sample from the movie adaptation of The Sheltering Sky (the same sample also opens Neurosis' Enemy Of The Sun, an album released in the same year as Scenes from the Second Storey), while the single Home contains an intro consisting of the beginning of the track Pilentze Pee by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir from the album Le MystÃƒÂ¨re des Voix Bulgares. The single peaked at #65 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1993.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74b5c7499c34f26137492203340562dd79d030c","amp;dn":"The+God+Machine+-+Scenes+From+The+Second+Storey+%28FLAC+HIGH+QUALI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74b5c7499c34f26137492203340562dd79d030c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,75,92,116,153,195,79,38,19,116,146,32,51,64,86,45,215,157,3,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
