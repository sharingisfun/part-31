Widely derided at the time, the show has never been realeased on video or DVD.\n\nThese are mp4 videos (H264/AVC) with AAC sound. The episodes are complete and include the end credits (the idiots who decided that squashing end credits was a good idea were not born in 1983).\n\nThe show features copious amounts of topless serving and dancing girls; those offended by the naked female bosom should avoid this series; the rest may care to observe a few ladies who became moderately famous, such as Carol Harrison and Shirin Taylor (as the Queen's handmaidens), Rita Wolf and Amanda Boxer.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55cf12e8e747b57800383469ed7e75ebde3f16d7","amp;dn":"The+Cleopatras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55cf12e8e747b57800383469ed7e75ebde3f16d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,207,18,232,231,71,181,120,0,56,52,105,237,126,117,235,222,63,22,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
