Doubtless owing to his exceptional mastery of and attentiveness to form, exemplified by his exceptional grasp of counterpoint, he has been described as a Romantic Classicist and therefore compared to Brahms. Furthermore, since he remained faithful to a traditional nineteenth century musical idiom, while some of his contemporaries pursued varieties of Modernism, critics have described Glazunov's music as academic and formal. But Glazunov's oeuvre, which includes a wide range of genres, cannot be easily reduced to mere\ncritical formulas. \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nTracks\nQuintet for Two Violins, Viola and Two Cellos in A Major, Opus 39\n1- Allegro\n2- Scherzo.
