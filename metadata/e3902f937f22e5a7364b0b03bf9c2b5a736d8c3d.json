These waking dreams wreak havoc for a guy who depends on real-life clues to make his living.\n\nClients havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly been beating down the door when Mark meets Jennifer TimesÃ¢â‚¬â€daughter of the powerful local D.A. and a contestant on American StarÃ¢â‚¬â€who walks into his office with an outlandish story about a man who stole her fingers.\n\nHe awakes from his latest hallucination alone, but on his desk is a manila envelope containing risquÃƒÂ© photos of Jennifer. Are the pictures real, and if so, is Mark hunting a blackmailer, or worse?\n\nWildly imaginative and with a pitch-perfect voice, The Little Sleep is the first in a new series that casts a fresh eye on the rigors of detective work, and introduces a character who has a lot to proveÃ¢â‚¬â€if only he can stay awake long enough to do it.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3902f937f22e5a7364b0b03bf9c2b5a736d8c3d","amp;dn":"The+Little+Sleep+by+Paul+Tremblay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3902f937f22e5a7364b0b03bf9c2b5a736d8c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,144,47,147,127,34,229,167,54,75,11,3,191,156,43,90,115,109,140,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
