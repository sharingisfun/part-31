After his girlfriend Sith died, he can't seem to go through a morning without monsters coming out of the bathroom mirror, or being pressed at school with his friends' concern over his well-being. All Guy wants is to be left alone. One night after a bad dream, Guy seeks solace in the graveyard by Sith's tombstone, and is confronted by an odd bunch of characters that will change his life forever with the promise that Sith might be alive! Meanwhile, a beautiful Goddess known as Good God has lost the key to heaven. She needs the help of her fellow compatriot, Evil God, to search for it down on Earth. But what starts off as a minor chore becomes more when Guy catches them in the graveyard, especially since Gods are supposed to be invisible to mortals...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dccba4fbd732e63eee475ef22cdec5a5072289","amp;dn":"Chandra+Free+-+The+God+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dccba4fbd732e63eee475ef22cdec5a5072289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,220,203,164,251,215,50,230,62,238,71,94,242,44,222,197,165,7,34,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
