When he discovers the body of a young woman on Midsummer Common, he is given the chance to work on a murder investigation for the first time in his career.\n\nSoon the victim is identified as Lorna Spence. Richard Moran, her boyfriend and employer, has reported her missing and is distraught to discover that she has been killed. He claims that she was loved by his staff, and that she had no enemies. But it isn't long before Goodhew discovers many who wouldn't have minded seeing her dead, including Spence's high maintenance colleague, Victoria ,and Goodhew's reckless former classmate, Bryn.\n\nThey both swear that they have nothing to do with Lorna's death, but someone is lying. After another brutal murder, Goodhew knows it is time to use his own initiative to flush out the killer, even though it means risking his job and discovering the truth about the one person he hopes will be innocent.\n\nGenre: Mystery, British ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:512ad5d7fccf5460261829476e058906f563158c","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Blue+by+Alison+Bruce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"512ad5d7fccf5460261829476e058906f563158c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,42,213,215,252,207,84,96,38,24,41,71,110,5,137,6,245,99,21,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
