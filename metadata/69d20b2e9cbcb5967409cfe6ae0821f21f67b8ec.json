Though they may not have been the most consistently popular Hip Hop act during their existence, they were able to bring the underground movement to the masses by combining their own Rap, Funk and Soul influences with a keen understanding of Pop music and popular culture. Disc One features their hits and album favorites while the second disc includes collaborations and remixes. Every track on this double disc collection is exceptional, including a clutch of tracks from their genre-bending 1989 debut album 3 Feet High &amp; Rising.
