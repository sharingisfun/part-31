Though rich, famous &amp; privy to sights and experiences most people can't imagine, something's missing - A direction. A purpose. A spark-\n\nWriter Karl Kesel and future superstar artist Skottie Young reignite that spark and redefine the FF's youngest, most impetuous member. Now more fire-like than ever, Johnny is capable of great warmth, and even greater fury. Is he always on the edge of exploding into a raging inferno, or just having so much fun he wants everyone to think so?!\n\nMore info: http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/49-23492/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9a15b8cd85036c948ae7d3e3a18acde63b294c","amp;dn":"Human+Torch+-+Human+Torch+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9a15b8cd85036c948ae7d3e3a18acde63b294c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,154,21,184,205,133,3,108,148,138,231,211,227,161,138,205,230,59,41,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
