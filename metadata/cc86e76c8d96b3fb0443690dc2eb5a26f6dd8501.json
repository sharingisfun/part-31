One would expect the son of Mel Brooks to have a genetic predisposition to humor, and indeed, he does, and he exhibits it relentlessly here: he outlines virtually every possible zombie-human encounter, drafts detailed plans for defense and attack and outlines past recorded attacks dating from 60,000 B.C. to 2002. In planning for that catastrophic day when &quot;the dead rise,&quot; Brooks urges readers to get to know themselves, their bodies, their weaponry, their surroundings and, just in case, their escape routes. Some of the book&amp;#039;s more amusing aspects are the laughable analyses Brooks proposes on all aspects of zombiehood, and the specificity with which he enumerates the necessary actions for survival-i.e., a member of an anti-zombie team must be sure to have with him at all times two emergency flares, a signaling mirror, daily rations, a personal mess kit and two pairs of socks. Comic, though unnecessarily exhaustive, this is a good bet for Halloween gag gifts and fans of Bored of the Rings-esque humor. 100 line drawings.\nCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\n\n\n################################################################################\n#                                                                              #\n#   DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU MISTAKE YOUR FLAT MATE FOR A ZOMBIE AND KILL HIM!   #\n#                                                                              #\n################################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc86e76c8d96b3fb0443690dc2eb5a26f6dd8501","amp;dn":"The+Zombie+Survival+Guide+-+FoxoF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc86e76c8d96b3fb0443690dc2eb5a26f6dd8501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,134,231,108,141,150,179,251,4,67,105,13,194,235,90,38,246,221,133,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
