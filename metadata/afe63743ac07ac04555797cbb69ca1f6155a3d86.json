The record\nwas already circulating in 2000 with a first distribution\nin concerts, but it was officially released to the market\nin 2001.\n\nThe lyrics of the song Her Only Nightgown came out of the\nfirst page of Dodie Smith's book I Captured The Castle -\nFilipe Miranda found this book in a street in south of\nSpain; this song was also released in compilation Promusica\n(Promusica, 2001) and Kafka (2002); the song Gandhi's Dream\nOf Chocolate was later used for a promotional video\nperformance made in Barcelos at the abandoned Vouga\nindustrial zone (2001).&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kafka-music.pt.vu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kafka-music.pt.vu/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFree DIY album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from\nthe artist's Bandcamp store (front cover from official web\nsite), ID3 tags and file names cleaned up, and everything\npacked comme il faut.
