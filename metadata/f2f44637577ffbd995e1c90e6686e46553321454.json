Using archive footage, Gods of Brazil tells the story of these two men and explains how one became the World&amp;#039;s Greatest Footballer and the other died a broken alcoholic at the age of 49.\n\n&quot;Who was the greatest footballer of all time? Most money will be placed on Pele, but this film offers an alternative. It suggests that the crown should go to Garrincha (it means &quot;little sparrow&quot;), a diminutive, near-disabled adolescent from northern Brazil who preceded Pele by a few years and built the Brazilan team&amp;#039;s international success with him.\n&quot;But this film is a treat because it&amp;#039;s made with an astonishing eye. The French director Jean-Christophe Ros? has made a series of films about sport, becoming something of a connoisseur in relation to the use of archive.\n&quot;You can wonder at the goals scored, I watched the film again and again. But you will also come away with a greater knowledge of just how it was that football was completely reinvented in the early 60s by Pele and Garrincha.&quot;\nNick Fraser\nStoryville Series Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Information\nBBC Storyville entry\nInterview with Alex Bellos\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1652 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 119kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 1:10:00\nPart Size: 893mb\nSubtitles: NO - TV CAP\nCapped by: AdamCook\n\nRelease Notes\n\nMuch of the footage is very antique and has obvious quality issues. But it is a fascinating and enlightening story. The tragic story of one of Brazil&amp;#039;s best-ever players, Garrincha, is often overlooked in favour of Pele, and this film rightly restores the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f44637577ffbd995e1c90e6686e46553321454","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2002+Gods+Of+Brazil+Pele+And+Garrincha+Dvbc+Xvid+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f44637577ffbd995e1c90e6686e46553321454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,244,70,55,87,127,251,217,149,225,201,14,102,134,228,101,83,50,20,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
