Often compared to artists like Massive Attack and Sade, the group was the brainchild of writer/producers Marc-George Anderson and Steffen Aaskoven. Vocalists Tchando and Alexandra Hamnede provide Bliss with soulful performances that reflect their alternately African-tinged and jazz-based foundations, resulting in an ethereal stew of pan-global atmosphere. The group has been a European fixture for years, debuting in North America in 2005 with Quiet Letters, a 12-track collection culled from both the first and second editions of the European release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8cd9fee6913985ff539509ebbcc393db10175e1","amp;dn":"Bliss+-+So+Many+of+Us+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8cd9fee6913985ff539509ebbcc393db10175e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,205,159,238,105,19,152,95,245,57,80,158,187,204,57,61,177,1,117,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
