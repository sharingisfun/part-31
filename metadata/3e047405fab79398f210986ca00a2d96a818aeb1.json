However, these have been ripped to multiple formats and standards. What I noticed is that there was both a shortage of the older films, and that many had not been ripped to the most basic and widely used format; Xvid AVI files. Many also had various other deficiencies, such as missing extras, no subtitles, low resolution, poor seeding, or comments from downloaders noting various technical problems.\n\nSo, I have endeavored to create new and clean, fresh rips, including all the extras and so forth. I am seeding each film (starting with the first BP winner, 1928s WINGS) individually, complete with full documentation and screenshots, and clearer labeling. A couple of the oldest films were swiped from existing torrents because a good commercial copy of the DVD is unavailable, but the rest are fresh rips IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made using DVDFab. My technical standards was to try to keep each film to at least .15 pixels. Each film has two passes.\n\n\n1941 - HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY (John Ford)\n\n1942 - MRS.
