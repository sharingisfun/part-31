Some contributions analyse the relevant case law on third-party liability and their implications for the future. The decisions on P2P also involve issues of international law and data protection. Other more forward-looking contributions provide original insight into the future shape of copyright in the online world, for instance whether it could or even should evolve towards a compensation system. By combining these avenues, the book will be of particular interest to practitioners and legal scholars.\n\n===================================================================================\nDescription II\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThis is a book that has a lot to offer.
