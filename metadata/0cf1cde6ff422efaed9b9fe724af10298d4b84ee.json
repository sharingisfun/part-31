With her singularly expressive contralto, Jackson continues to inspire the generations of vocalists who follow in her wake; among the first spiritual performers to introduce elements of blues into her music, she infused gospel with a sensuality and freedom it had never before experienced, and her artistry rewrote the rules forever. Born in one of the poorest sections of New Orleans on October 16, 1911, Jackson made her debut in the children's choir of the Plymouth Rock Baptist Church at the age of four, and within a few years was a prominent member of the Mt. Moriah Baptist's junior choir. Raised next door to a sanctified church, she was heavily influenced by their brand of gospel, with its reliance on drums and percussion over piano; another major inspiration was the blues of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tGospel\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Walk In Jerusalem\n02.The Upper Room\n03.It Is No Secret ( What God Can Do )\n04.Then The Answer Came\n05.Just Over The Hill\n06.Thas's What He's Done For Me\n07.Move On Up A Little Higher\n08.Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen\n09.I Believe\n10.Crying In The Chapel\n11.We Shall Overcome\n12.When The Saints Go Marching In\n13.Down By The Riverside\n14.The Green Leaves Of Summer\n15.Danny Boy\n16.Joshua Fit The Battle Of Jericho\n17.Put A Little Love In Your Heart\n18.Though You're Reeling And Rocking\n19.Go Tell It On The Mountain\n20.Nobody But Jesus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cf1cde6ff422efaed9b9fe724af10298d4b84ee","amp;dn":"Mahailia+Jackson+-+Greatest+Hits+%281995%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cf1cde6ff422efaed9b9fe724af10298d4b84ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,241,205,230,255,66,46,250,237,155,159,231,36,175,16,41,141,75,132,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
