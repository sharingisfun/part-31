Formed in 1969, the group consists of Billy Gibbons (guitar and vocals), Dusty Hill (bass and vocals), and Frank Beard (drums and percussion). ZZ Top's early sound was rooted in blues but eventually became part of the Southern Rock wave. Their lyrics often gave evidence of band's humor and thematically focus on personal experiences and sexual innuendos.\nMaintaining the same members for over forty years, ZZ Top has released 14 studio albums and are among the most popular rock groups, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. In 2004, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \nHomepage:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.zztop.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.zztop.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZ_Top_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZ_Top_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[from Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nPeople can be divided into three groups: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened.\n\n.
