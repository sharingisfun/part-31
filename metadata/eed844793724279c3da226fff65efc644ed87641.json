While he was never brought to trial for the \ncharges against him during his rule, he and his followers took the country into the deepest pits of despair.\n\nAs a child, the young Saloth Sar, as Pol Pot was originally named, lived well off of his father, who was a \nwealthy land owner more than he was a farmer. Pol Pot in Cambodian literally means Politique Potentielle, in French, \nor Potential Politics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a form of extreme communism in which Pot religiously believed and changed his name to match. \nPol, his brother, sister, and a cousin were favored be the Kingdom Monivong, which entitled them to some privileges \nnot bestowed upon other Cambodian families. While living in the royal palace for a time, he witnessed what feudalistic \npower was dealt. During this time, Pol Pot attended various French language schools, but was either not bright enough \nor simply did not try to pass his classes. When he failed at earning his diploma and later becoming a monk, his family \nsent him to France to study, where he also failed academically. Politics struck his fancy and he joined the French \nCommunist Party in the early 1950s. Following, he gained some military know-how in Yugoslavia before returning to Cambodia.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Pol Pot began teaching in a private school in Phnom Penh and began a leadership role in CambodiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nCommunist Party. When he visited China, he saw how the Cultural Revolution controlled and affected the entire country. \nWith support from the Communist government there, he went back to Cambodia and with an ignited fervor to bring Cambodia \nto utopian standards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve ideology that became his obsession.\n\nIn the Cambodian coup of 1970, which was in support of American involvement in the country, the Khmer Rouge \n(or Cambodian Communists) began attacking the Cambodian army. When the U.S. began bombing other parts of the country, \nCambodia began distrusting their supposed American allies. The Khmer RougeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s popularity grew rapidly and before anyone \ncould realize it, Pol Pot and his army had taken the capital. Pol Pot became the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decisive ruler, and thereafter \nbegan the torturing, murdering, and near genocide of his own people. By sending inhabitants of the city into forced labor \ncamps, or communes, disease, starvation, and death became the norm. The countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s economy plummeted and the society became \ndepressed and repressed. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were overthrown by Vietnam, but even through the 1990s, Pol Pot wreaked \nhavoc on Cambodia. He died by suicide, murder, or heart failure in 1998 before he could be brought to trial.\n\n\nVideo Info\nPol.Pot.Inside.Evil.2005.TVrip.704x368.xvid.mp3-snach.avi\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 293 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 41s\nOveral bit rate                  : 960 Kbps\nWriting library                  : MediaCoder 0.6\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warpoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 42mn 41s\nBit rate                         : 822 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.913\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.127\nStream size                      : 251 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 41s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 39.1 MiB\n\n\nTrackers:\nhttp://tracker.conspiracycentral.net/announce\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:669/announce\n\nVisit &amp; Join us at:\nhttp://tracker.ConspiracyCentral.net\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed844793724279c3da226fff65efc644ed87641","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+-+Pol+Pot%3A+Inside+Evil+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed844793724279c3da226fff65efc644ed87641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,216,68,121,55,36,39,156,61,162,38,255,246,94,252,100,78,216,118,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
