Via telephone, the Best and most famous blues musicians of Europe were called together as guests\nand they met each other in the Jovel studio at MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nster in the North of Germany. The Jovel studio is a former cinema,a large, well-resounding room, in which there are many live concerts. \n\nThe fact that all Instruments - including the bass guitar\n - were played at normal concert volume via amplifiers, \ngave also rise to the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»live feelingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â«.\nAfter last auditions during the soundchecks, a maximum of 3 takes were recorded \n- in most cases, just one was needed. \n\nThe recordings were such a great fun for the band that after 3 days and 47 hours \nin the studio they could not refrain from making a session.\n\n... we hope that you have as much fun listening to this work as we had recording it.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bluescompany.de/en/index.php?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bluescompany.de/en/index.php?lang=en&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Company&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Company&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3b074b84c5d8f55cc4ac4ca8383e2df34135e0","amp;dn":"Blues+Company+-+So+What+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3b074b84c5d8f55cc4ac4ca8383e2df34135e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,59,7,75,132,197,216,245,92,196,172,76,168,56,62,45,243,65,53,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
