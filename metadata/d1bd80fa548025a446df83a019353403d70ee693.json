With their exotic accents, smart uniforms, and aura of Hollywood glamour, the G.I.s easily conquered their hearts, leaving British boys fighting abroad green with envy. But for girls like Sylvia, Margaret, Gwendolyn, and even the skeptical Rae, American soldiers offered something even more tantalizing than chocolate, chewing gum, and nylon stockings: an escape route from Blitz-ravaged Britain, an opportunity for a new life in affluent, modern America.\n\nThrough the stories of these four women, G.I. Brides illuminates the experiences of war brides who found themselves in a foreign culture thousands of miles away from family and friends, with men they hardly knew. Some struggled with the isolation of life in rural America, or found their soldier less than heroic in civilian life. But most persevered, determined to turn their wartime romance into a lifelong love affair, and prove to those back home that a Hollywood ending of their own was possible.\n\nG.I. Brides includes an eight-pages insert that features 45-black-and-white photos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1bd80fa548025a446df83a019353403d70ee693","amp;dn":"GI+Brides+%28Duncan+Barrett+and+Nuala+Calvi%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1bd80fa548025a446df83a019353403d70ee693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,189,128,250,84,128,37,164,70,223,131,160,25,53,52,3,215,14,230,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
