This incisive book probes the dynamics that inform the nation's domestic and foreign policies, examining key leadership institutions and personalities, as well as prospects for the next regime.\n\nIn outlining the major events behind Kim Chong-il's assumption of power, Ken E. Gause illuminates the environment that shaped Chong-il's worldview and his concept of the regime and his role in it. The book focuses on regime politics since 1994. Among other critical topics, the book examines the evolution of North Korean decision-making with regard to its internal and external affairs and how both are intermingled. The prospects for a third hereditary succession and the prospective stability of the next regime are also considered.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/North-Korea-under-Chong--International/dp/0313381755/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324336917&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/North-Korea-under-Chong--International/dp/0313381755/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324336917&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eef27065cb841dcfd77d173a497a136411bb6fa","amp;dn":"North+Korea+under+Kim+Chong-il%3A+Power%2C+Politics%2C+and+Prospects+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eef27065cb841dcfd77d173a497a136411bb6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,239,39,6,92,184,65,220,253,119,209,115,164,151,161,54,65,27,182,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
