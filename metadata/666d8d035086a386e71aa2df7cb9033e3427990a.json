These 'Streamline' edits run shorter because they are missing teasers, cartoons, flashbacks, repetition, idents, history lessons, fun facts, &quot;we're experts&quot;, and anything else that slows down the show.\n\nThis is Mythbusters, the way it's meant to be seen.\n\nAll credit for these edits goes to reddit users Postdarwin, Runke, Myfbusted, MrTwinkles, Realblublu, Ram27, DeLoRtEd1, and Arantius. Postdarwin created the subreddit /r/smyths and you should go there if you want to find more streamlined episodes.\n\n*changelog for v2013.8.23 - updated s12e08 to fixed version\n\t\t\t  - added s06e07\n\t\t\t  - added s07e04\n\t\t\t  - added s06e08\n\t\t\t  - added s12e10\n\t\t\t  - added s08e05\n\t\t\t  - added s01e04\n\t\t\t  - added s05e08\n\t\t\t  - added s08e09\n\t\t\t  - added s12e09\n\t\t\t  - added s07e07\n\t\t\t  - added s04e23\n\t\t\t  - added s06e12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:666d8d035086a386e71aa2df7cb9033e3427990a","amp;dn":"Streamlined+Mythbusters+Complete+%28as+of+August+23rd%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"666d8d035086a386e71aa2df7cb9033e3427990a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,109,141,3,80,134,163,134,231,26,162,223,124,185,3,62,52,39,153,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
