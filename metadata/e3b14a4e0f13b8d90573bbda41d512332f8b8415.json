The first one called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ascent From HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is about a corpse that wakes up in Hell and finds out he must go back to earth to find his soul that still lives on inside the body of a priest and drag it back to Hell.\n\nFor this first recording, metal icons Paul Bostaph from Slayer on drums, Steve Smyth from Nevermore on lead guitar and Damien Sisson from Death Angel on bass were recruited to make this record happen. This recording is diabolically epic, and heavy as Hell! Every song is different from the next covering many genres of metal from thrash metal and black metal to death metal and doom metal. This album is as dynamic as metal can be! Also participating in this recording is Phil Bennett of the iconic rock band Starship, playing piano on the track Dead Reckoning and a 22-piece choir, The Pacific Mozart Ensemble on four other tracks. Establishing new ground, this record has the first recorded blast beat by Paul Bostaph, orchestrated with shredding guitar solos from Steve Smyth and heavy melodic &amp; syncopated bass by Damien Sisson.\n\nProduced by George Anderson and Steve Ã¢â‚¬Å“SnakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Green, guitar player from Skinlab, a Century Media recording artist, this recording is a theatrical 70 minutes long with segues in between each song to give additional detail to this horror story. Once the music starts, it never stops until the end.\n\nGeorge Anderson aka Aleister Sinn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The narrator and character in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ascent From HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Sinn is The God of Hell, God of Night, and God of the Living Dead. He was created to tell these heavy metal horror stories, influenced by the mighty King Diamond. Prior to this project, George was the vocalist and lead guitar player for the Oakland based thrash band, Down Factor. Performing on two releases, Pure (2003) and Murder the World (2005).\n\nPaul Bostaph, legendary icon of thrash metal, has played for Slayer, Testament, Exodus and Forbidden and toured the world over influencing metal bands and drummers in every country. Bostaph joined Slayer in early 1992 and toured and recorded with them for almost a decade.\n\nMost notable is his drumming on 'Judgment Night' soundtrack with Ice T, Divine Intervention (1993), Undisputed Attitude (1995), Diabolus In Musica (1997) and Grammy nominated Ã¢â‚¬ËœGod Hates Us AllÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2001) in addition to these recordings, Paul also recorded ExodusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Shovel Headed Kill Machine and TestamentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Formation of DamnationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nDamien Sission plays bass for old-school thrashers, Death Angel and Potential Threat. He joined Death Angel in November 2009 and recorded their 6th album, Relentless Retribution and The Dream Calls for Blood (2013). He has performed in over 30 countries, toured and played alongside other great bands such as Testament, Metallica, Anthrax and Sepultura. He continues to play and record with Death Angel and Potential Threat. Damien has also played bass for Exhumed and Scarecrow.\nimage\nSteve Smyth, metal guitar shred master, has played and recorded guitar for legendary acts Forbidden, Nevermore, Testament, Dragonlord and Vicious Rumors. He has signed with many labels and toured in just about every country. He has also performed voice-overs for Metalocalypse and has signature B.C. Rich 6 and 7-string Guitars. Steve continues to record and write for his new band One Machine and The Esseness Project.\n\nQuote:\nAny album which starts in hell, the walls of the inferno closing in as harrowing screams abound, gets my vote from the off. Given that the band have named themselves From Hell, their intentions, of course, were largely clear from the outset, but the fact that they have given credence to their chosen moniker with such a brutal opening track is certainly laudable. A heavy metal super-group featuring the mighty Paul Bostaph (Slayer / Testament), Damien Sisson (Death Angel) and Steve Smyth (Nevermore/ Testament), From Hell play a wondrous range of heavy metal, each track designed to tell a story in the vein of King Diamond, with the result that Ã¢â‚¬ËœAscent from hellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a masterclass in storytelling and dissecting the genre of heavy metal. Prepare for hellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nOpening with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstanding at the mouth of hellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a short, instrumental piece that breathes fire and brimstone, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe walking deadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opens the album proper with a furious and toxic blast of primal death metal. The guitars scream and burn, the vocals are ground out through a mouthful of broken glass and shattered teeth and there is no questioning the adrenalin rush that accompanies the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s furious riffs and scarifying vocals. As all the songs on the album do, the track ends with a short instrumental segue that links the album together thematically and musically. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSoul crusherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is no less effective, PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incomparable percussive assault underpinning George AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unholy roar and SteveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inventive lead guitar work. The songs are long, soaked in hellfire and perspiration, but never dull, the band demonstrating not only their unique individual talents but also the ability to work in concert, George playing the demented ringleader as the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale of bloodshed and mayhem unfolds. With the sound of dangling chains still ringing in our ears, the tale gets darker as sinister chords overlay the sound of a particularly brutal murder before the band unleash the pure sonic evil of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpsycho killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a grinding slab of metal that ranges through a variety of moods and tempos as the band let the tale unfold over a thrillingly brutal eight minutes. This is pure, unhinged and apocalyptically vital metal and it is one of the best riffs IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come across in months. Adrenalin soaked, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPsycho killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is one of those rare songs that sends your body into fight or flight mode, supercharging the nervous system and leaving you feeling as if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been in a fight with the titular character. It is an early highlight of the album, but such is the overall strength of song writing that it is not the only one.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœEyes of my deadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ emerges out of the dark chants of the dead, a 22 piece choir providing the blood curdling backing that leads into the disturbingly placid track only for Steve to suddenly slam out a riff of such primal fury that it tears right across the surface of the song leaving you flattened by its sheer propulsive power. A schizophrenic, multi-faceted song, what makes both the song, and the band, stand out is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to effortlessly move between styles which keeps even the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest songs endlessly entertaining. The amusingly titled Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnun with a gunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shorter songs at a mere six minutes. Powered by a molten guitar riff, it sounds like Megadeth being covered by High on fire with its furious rhythm and acid-gargle vocals whilst the chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nun with a gun, hallelujah!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ will surely bring a smile to the face even as you bang your head. The story continues with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a track that begins with a gruesome discovery and which proves to be a gloriously unhinged mix of neo-classical melodies, relentless soloing and Paul BostaffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s merciless, deathly beats underpinning GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s furious delivery. Gloriously original, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not hear another extreme band craft such a beguiling mix of hypnotic, brutal metal this year, and such is the scope of the music that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise that elements of doom appear in the latter stages, or that a choir briefly sweetens the sound even as the riffs are at their most deadly. At nine minutes, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdead reckoningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the band at their most diverse as they are joined by StarshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Phil Bennett on piano for an epic slab of grandiose metal. However, the song falls down a touch where George employs clean vocals that lack both control and power Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on future ventures it would be worth considering employing a separate clean vocalist especially if the vocals, as they do here, have to compete with the tender ministrations of a choir. However, when the song hits a more brutal note the band return to form and the song overall is a success, but it is the weakest piece on the album. In contrast the rumbling riffs and throbbing bass of the title track sound like a summoning of pure evil and as George employs screams that tear straight from the heart of the abyss, the band indulge in their darkest passions, grinding out riffs that smoke and smoulder in the pale daylight. The album closes with another lengthy piece, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe sleepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which opens with a richly textured synth part and then segues into ferocious death metal underpinned as ever by Damien SissonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richly rewarding bass work. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fitting conclusion to both the album and the story and it leaves you gagging for more from this most inventive of extreme metal bands.\nimage\nOverall From Hell more than deliver on the promise of the concept. The musicians involved were born to create this type of evil concept album, and it is their stunning musicianship that raises what could well have been a contrived mess to an art form. The art work, the cleverly constructed story and the excellent production are all perfect and the only slight criticism that I have for the album is that the clean vocals on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdead reckoningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lack the power and range that they needed. Imagine someone like ICS Vortex performing the role, with his rich, clean voice, and you would have had the perfect song. This is, however, a minor point and overall you could not ask for a better, more ambitious or imaginative concept metal album. Extreme, brilliantly conceived and played, this is a rare gem that is more or less essential listen for fans of intelligent, brutal metal. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAscent from hellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a stunning effort and worth far more than the not inconsiderable sum of its parts. Make sure you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss out on this one.\n\nLine-up:\n\nGeorge Anderson -aka Aleister Sinn - vocals and lead guitar\nSteve Smyth - lead guitar\nPaul Bostaph - drums\nDamien Sisson - Bass\n\nimage\nFrom Hell - Ascent From Hell (2014)\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
