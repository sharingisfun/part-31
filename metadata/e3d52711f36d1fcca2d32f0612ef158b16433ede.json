Carlile's earthy pop\nock is a far cry from classical fare, perhaps, but the pairing doesn't sound as \nodd as you'd think. With their cathartic melodies and storybook lyrics, her \nsongs have always tended to fare equally well in acoustic settings and full-\nband arrangements. Backed by a full orchestra, they take on an anthemic \nquality while still highlighting everything that makes Carlile's music so \nappealing, keeping the spotlight on her voice -- which has never sounded \nbetter -- and festooning it with all sorts of pretty flourishes. Occasionally, the \nsymphony pulls away entirely, leaving Carlile and her longtime backing band \n-- including brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth, who perform a spot-on cover of \n&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; toward the end of the set -- to remind everyone what \nthe core of this music sounds like. But Live at Benaroya Hall is more \nconcerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and \nthe results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of &quot;The Story&quot; -- now \nfeaturing horns, woodwinds, and strings -- to the graceful ebb and flow of \nLeonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; which vacillates between simple guitar \narpeggios and lush symphonic swells. This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert \nalbum, but it's certainly the best.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 5/3/2011\nLabel: Sony\nCatalog Number: 785087\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d52711f36d1fcca2d32f0612ef158b16433ede","amp;dn":"Brandi+Carlile+-+Live+at+Benaroya+Hall+with+the+Seattle+Symphony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d52711f36d1fcca2d32f0612ef158b16433ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,213,39,17,243,109,31,204,162,211,47,6,18,239,21,139,22,67,62,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
