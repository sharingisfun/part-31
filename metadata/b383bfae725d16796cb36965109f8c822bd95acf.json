Lessons from the Video Master offers three films that help illuminate Paik's art and life. The title film from video artist Skip Blumberg comprises 47 stylized but insightful interviews with Paik's friends, collaborators, and proteges. Recorded at the artist's memorial service, the film brings together such art-world luminaries as Merce Cunningham, Yoko Ono, and Paik's nephew, Ken Paik Hakuta. Bonus Art Video contains 17 additional interviews from New York City's art community, including video-art curator David Ross and avant-garde film pioneer Jonas Mekas, and features a video-within-a-video of Yoko Ono's performance for Paik at the Guggenheim Museum. Lastly, there's a nine-minute edit of Lessons from the Video Artist suitable for high-school and middle-school students.\n\n\nFurther Information:\n\nThe DVD is produced by NJPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend and colleague, Skip Blumberg, himself one of the first generation of video artists and an award-winning documentary videomaker. His videos are distributed by EAI.org, VDB.org and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nMade possible with public funds from the NYS Council on the Arts, a State Agency, and support from the Experimental TV Center.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b383bfae725d16796cb36965109f8c822bd95acf","amp;dn":"Nam+June+Paik-Lessons+From+The+Master+-+Skip+Blumberg+96+min+200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b383bfae725d16796cb36965109f8c822bd95acf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,131,191,174,114,93,22,121,108,179,105,101,16,159,140,130,43,217,90,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
