Its hilarious and cool. Meryl Streep, is superb and funny and knows how to light up the screen. This is definatly one of my favourite films of all time and very good if you want a laugh. Death Becomes Her has great special effects and is an excellent &amp;#039;black comedy&amp;#039;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c88d8a2b5f09f5301ee588c12514ea6cf7e87068","amp;dn":"Death+Becomes+Her","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c88d8a2b5f09f5301ee588c12514ea6cf7e87068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,141,138,43,95,9,245,48,30,229,136,193,37,20,234,108,247,232,112,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
