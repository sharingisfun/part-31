Sometimes it is so violent it's more like a punch: the death of a loved one, a serious illness, a major injury, a freak accident, a shocking crime, a disabled child, the loss of a job; bankruptcy, betrayal, fire, flood, divorce or disaster. Sometimes it's a little gentler: envy, loneliness, resentment, failure, disappointment or rejection. But whatever form it takes, one thing's for sure: it hurts! And most of us don't deal with the pain very well.\n\nWithin these pages, you will learn how to cope effectively when life hurts: not just how to survive, but how to thrive. Using the proven principles of ACT, you'll discover how to:\n\n* find peace in the midst of your pain\n* find calm in the midst of your chaos\n* anchor yourself in the midst of emotional storms\n* increase your sense of connection with yourself and others\n* use your painful emotions to cultivate wisdom and compassion\n* find fulfilment even when you can't get what you want\n* heal your wounds, and come through stronger than before\n\nMP3 - 192 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb8e3e5262cfb55c3241dfe83c8293f5e177a74","amp;dn":"Exercises+%26amp%3B+Meditations+from+The+Reality+Slap+%28Dr+Russ+Harri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb8e3e5262cfb55c3241dfe83c8293f5e177a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,184,227,229,38,44,251,85,195,36,29,254,131,200,41,63,94,23,122,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
