At the time, nobody knew Symphonie Pour le Jour oÃƒÂ¹ BrÃƒÂ»leront les CitÃƒÂ©s (Symphony for the Day Cities Will Burn) would be the first of many albums from this strange chamber progressive rock outfit. All the ingredients of Art Zoyd's sound for its first decade are here: unusual acoustic instrumentation for a rock band (violin, cello, piano, and trumpet, plus guitar, bass, and percussion), dark and mysterious atmospheres recalling France's Magma and foretelling Univers Zero (formed by Art Zoyd percussionist Daniel Denis), and complex pieces owing as much to contemporary classical as to progressive rock. \n\nThe lineup for this first offering included Patricia Dallio (piano), Alain Eckert (guitar, vocals), GÃƒÂ©rard Hourbette (violin), Jean-Pierre Soarez (trumpet, percussion), and Thierry ZaboÃƒÂ¯tzeff (bass, cello, vocals).\n\nThe album is split in two.\n\nFirst is Symphonie Pour le Jour oÃƒÂ¹ BrÃƒÂ»leront les CitÃƒÂ©s in three parts, an apocalyptic work opening with mad laughter, a vision of the end of the world with percussion clashing, frenetic violin motifs, and the trumpet from Judgment Day. Part one, Brigades SpÃƒÂ©ciales, is the most striking moment of the album.\n\nThen comes Deux Images de la CitÃƒÂ© ImbÃƒÂ©cile ('Two Pictures of the Stupid City'), two movements leaning more toward some warped chamber rock conception of the burlesque, especially on ScÃƒÂ¨nes de Carnaval.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:151d0bcac1cdf0adf50856a8926e477c5cb5ae9a","amp;dn":"Art+Zoyd+%281976%29+Symphonie+Pour+Le+Jour+O%26ugrave%3B+Br%26ucirc%3Bleront","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"151d0bcac1cdf0adf50856a8926e477c5cb5ae9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,29,11,202,193,205,240,173,245,8,86,168,146,110,71,124,92,181,174,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
