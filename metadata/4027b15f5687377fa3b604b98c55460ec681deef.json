A Fair Exchange 1:52\n\nMp3 blogs are blamed for every music-in-the-digital-age woe: declining CD sales, blink-and-you-miss-it hype cycles, cavalier attitudes towards copyright, loss of paying music journalism jobs. What you don't hear so much is how these sites create and foster communities-- virtual ones, obviously, but geographical ones too. Like many other indie bands, Edinburgh's Meursault are releasing their new LP on a small, local label. The difference is that Song, by Toad Records is a spinoff of a successful mp3 blog and podcast of the same name. Together they comprise a triple threat that the Scotsman has called the &quot;DIY front-line of the city's homespun and rapidly expanding music scene.&quot; Think globally, act locally, eh?\nAt this point, Meursault have little name recognition beyond the borders of Edinburgh or Hype Machine. But All Creatures Will Make Merry, a more developed and thoughtful follow-up to their craggy 2008 debut, Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues, could change that. Don't let the album title fool you: Like fellow Scots Frightened Rabbit and the Twilight Sad, Meursault are ambassadors of misery, self-loathing, and huge, heart-heavy choruses. Most sad bastards can generate a modicum of optimism on January 1. But on &quot;Crank Resolutions&quot;, the sadder bastards in Meursault declare, &quot;I broke down on New Year's Day/ And I mixed my drinks/ And I lost my way,&quot; among hyperventilating electronic beats and pyrrhic victory shouts. It's enormous fun, of course, and I can't wait to see a live audience sob along to every word.\nX Lossless Decoder version 20101212 (126.2)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4027b15f5687377fa3b604b98c55460ec681deef","amp;dn":"Meursault...All+Creatures+Will+Make+Merry%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4027b15f5687377fa3b604b98c55460ec681deef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,39,177,95,86,135,55,127,163,182,4,185,140,85,70,14,198,129,222,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
