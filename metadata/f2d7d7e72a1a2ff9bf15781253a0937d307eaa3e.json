In this course, learn how to use Backbone models and collections to manage your data, while displaying it through views. Author Joseph LeBlanc shows you how to use events to change an application's state and avoid messy nested callback functions. He explores modifying resources on the server side via models that reflect the changes in your application, tune your application's performance, and keep the JavaScript environment clear of excessive global variables. He also covers supplementary tools based on Backbone that provide additional functionality.\n\nTopics include:\n- What is Backbone.js?\n- Starting a node server\n- Building routes\n- Creating views\n- Reusing views and building view templates\n- Defining models\n- Loading remote data\n- Organizing collections\n- Adding and removing models\n- Saving and deleting data\n- Bootstrapping data\n- Finding Backbone resources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d7d7e72a1a2ff9bf15781253a0937d307eaa3e","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Backbone.js","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d7d7e72a1a2ff9bf15781253a0937d307eaa3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,215,215,231,42,26,47,249,191,21,120,18,83,160,147,125,48,126,170,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
