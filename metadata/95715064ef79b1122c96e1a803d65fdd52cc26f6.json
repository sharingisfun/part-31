Some people have commented that this makes it somewhat hard to read on screen (though I didn't really have a problem). Either way it looks fine when printed out.\n\nPreface I CF communicator: Talks about the format of the book and the importance of simplicity in training.\n\nPreface II CF Coach: Explains about the people who have contributed to Charlie's coaching philosophy.\n\nPreface III High performance: Sets the scene regarding high performance in track and field and answers questions about the conventions used in the book and explains about the importance of regeneration to athletic performance.\n\nPreface IV &quot;Sprint Training&quot; it underlies Sports ranging from gymnastics to soccer.

The role of muscle tone on performance is also highlighted and the chapter ends with a quick summary of all the elements that go into a full training programme.\n\nChapter 4 Strength TrainingStrength training for sprinting is discussed in depth with comments from Dr Tudor Bompa.
