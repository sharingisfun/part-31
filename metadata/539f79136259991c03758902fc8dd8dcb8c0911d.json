It came in a pack of PC/MAC games for school aged children.\n\nThe discs all reference www.somc.com but that site seems to belong to another group now.  The phone number for technical support on the disc is 1 800 878 9942.  The other discs in this pack (all SOMC) are all &quot;reader rabbit's&quot; and other The Learning Company software.  I have a feeling these discs were made by a company that was bought by TLC\n\nSo perhaps SOMC is an old company name. &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.aboutus.org/Somc.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.aboutus.org/Somc.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAny how, I think all Trekkie fans, young and old will like it.  I do not know if it is MAC compatible as the disc doesn't say and I don't have a Mac.\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539f79136259991c03758902fc8dd8dcb8c0911d","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Captain%5C%27s+Chair+from+SOMC+Holiday+Treasures+Childre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539f79136259991c03758902fc8dd8dcb8c0911d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,159,121,19,98,89,153,28,3,117,137,2,252,141,216,220,184,192,145,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
