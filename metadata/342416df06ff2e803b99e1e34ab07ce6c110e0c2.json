All the comics contained in this torrent were taken from other torrents freely available to anyone who wished to download them. Most simply consisted of individual jpegs or png image files.  What I have attempted to do is convert these in to a comic book Kindle format with &quot;panel-view&quot; so they can be viewed on various Kindles, (Kindle Fire, Fire HD, Kindle Paperview, Kindle 3 and Kindle Keyboards with the most recent updates).\n\nRecently, Amazon came out with &quot;Kindle Comic Creator&quot;.  With this new application it is quite easy, (though time consuming), to create comics with &quot;panel-view&quot; from raw image files.  The resulting KF8, mobi files are easily read with the kindle magnifying each panel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:342416df06ff2e803b99e1e34ab07ce6c110e0c2","amp;dn":"JAB+Comix+in+Kindle+Panelview+format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"342416df06ff2e803b99e1e34ab07ce6c110e0c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,36,22,223,6,255,46,128,59,153,225,227,74,176,124,230,193,16,224,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
