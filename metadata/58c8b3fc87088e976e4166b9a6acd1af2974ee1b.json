While the debut wasn't a huge pop hit, it made an immediate\nimpact in the R&amp;B community. The synthesized backbeat of &quot;You Are In My\nSystem&quot; rose up the charts and made Murphy and Frank the hot R&amp;B production\ntandem of the day. The rest of Sweat wasn't quite as successful, but it had\nalready launched them into stardom.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c8b3fc87088e976e4166b9a6acd1af2974ee1b","amp;dn":"The+System+-+Sweat+%281983%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c8b3fc87088e976e4166b9a6acd1af2974ee1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,200,179,252,135,8,142,151,110,65,102,185,166,172,209,175,41,116,238,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
