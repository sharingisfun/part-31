Since crashing into the Top 20 towards the end of 1997 with the line-dancing inspired &quot;5,6,7,8&quot; (the &quot;in&quot; craze at the time) the group have been constantly churning out top-notch tunes. Their videos have been as equally colourful, energetic and fun (apart from the video to &quot;When I Said Goodbye&quot; which was shot in black and white). With their carefully choreographed dance moves, flashy locations and outrageous hairstyles and outfits, the videos have always been a top priority for the group. This collection ranges from the video for their more recent cover of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; deceptively filmed in one continuous take, to the beach fun of &quot;5,6,7,8&quot; and are excellently matched to the style of each song. Admittedly some of the videos are rather cheesy, such as &quot;Say You'll Be Mine&quot;, which is a pastiche of the group re-enacting scenes from recent Hollywood blockbusters, and the sleigh ride scene in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (also the &quot;bad hair&quot; era for the female members of Steps). However the videos work best when a soap opera-style narrative is introduced, as with their flat-sitting escapades in the &quot;Stomp&quot; video, and the &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; inspired video for their first number one single &quot;Tragedy&quot;.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Chain Reaction 3.53\n[02] Here And Now 3.26\n[03] You'll Be Sorry 3.34\n[04] It's The Way You Make Me Feel 3.11\n[05] Stomp 3.13\n[06] Summer Of Love 3.49\n[07] When I Said Goodbye 3.28\n[08] Deeper Shade Of Blue 3.38\n[09] Say You'll Be Mine 4.22\n[10] Better The Devil You Know 3.26\n[11] After The Love Has Gone 3.57\n[12] Love's Got A Hold On My Heart 3.15\n[13] Better Best Forgotten 3.22\n[14] Tragedy 4.23\n[15] Heartbeat 4.17\n[16] One For Sorrow 3.50\n[17] Last Thing On My Mind 3.00\n[18] 5,6,7,8 3.18\n[19] One For Sorrow (US Remix) 3.30\n[20] Too Busy Thinking About My Baby 2.57\n\n[01] Steps - 1st Impressions\n[02] Steps Moments\n[03] Chain Reaction - Behind The Scenes\n[04] Steps Commentary On - 5,6,7,8\n[05] Steps Commentary On - Deeper Shade Of Blue\n[06] Steps Commentary On - Heartbeat\n[07] Steps Commentary On - Tragedy\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 1.98GB (Including Videos, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Mpeg\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal DVD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 15 October 2001\nRecord Company\t&gt; Zomba Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.pop-music.com/steps\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_%28group%29\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/steps.html\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/steps\n&gt;[Tragedy]\n&gt;[5,6,7,8]\n&gt;[Last Thing On My Mind]\n&gt;[Chain Reaction]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:581986e153ce59dc766e01e14edd99c1465d6ae6","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Gold+%28Greatest+Hits+Videos%29+-+Steps+1.98GB+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"581986e153ce59dc766e01e14edd99c1465d6ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,25,134,225,83,206,89,220,118,110,1,225,78,221,153,193,70,93,106,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
