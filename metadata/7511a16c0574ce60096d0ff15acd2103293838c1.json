Pyke, sometime Bow Street Runner, sometime crook, finds himself embroiled in the investigation but quickly realises he has stumbled into something more far-reaching. In his pursuit of the murderer, Pyke ruffles the feathers of some powerful people, and finds himself falsely accused of murder. From the gutters of Seven Dials, to the cells of Newgate prison; from the turmoil of 1800s Belfast to murky, pre-Victorian politics, this is a gripping story with a reluctantly heroic hero.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7511a16c0574ce60096d0ff15acd2103293838c1","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+of+Newgate+-+Andrew+Pepper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7511a16c0574ce60096d0ff15acd2103293838c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,17,161,108,5,116,206,96,9,109,15,241,90,205,33,3,41,56,56,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
