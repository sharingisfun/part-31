A gang leader (Michael Gambon), accompanied by his wife (Helen Mirren) and his associates, entertains himself every night in a fancy French restaurant that he has recently bought. Having tired of her sadistic, boorish husband, the wife finds herself a lover (Alan Howard) and makes love to him in the restaurant's coziest places with the silent permission of the cook (Richard Bohringer). Though less cerebral than Greenaway's other films, featuring deadly passions reminiscent of Jacobean revenge tragedies of the early 17th century, the picture still offers the director's usual ironic and paradoxical comments on the relations between eating and sex, love and death. The film is at once funny and horrific, and those who are not used to Greenaway's peculiar style might be even disgusted or shocked; however, one might mention Sacha Vierny's brilliant camerawork, Jean-Paul Gaultier's gaudily stylized costumes, and Michael Nyman's somber, pulsating music, which will haunt the viewer long after the film's end.\n\nFile Name .........................................: The Cook the Thief His Wife &amp; Her Lover.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,866,799,104 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:59:10\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x296 (AR: 2.378)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1887 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.362 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese  (srt)\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:197b9dd99dadfd6327aaa4b22561f79501e29911","amp;dn":"The+Cook+the+Thief+His+Wife+%26amp%3B+Her+Lover+%28Peter+Greenway%2C+198","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"197b9dd99dadfd6327aaa4b22561f79501e29911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,123,157,217,157,173,253,99,39,170,164,178,37,97,247,149,1,226,153,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
