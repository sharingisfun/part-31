Thomason\n\nBook Description\nBeing a CEOÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son in the top one percent of income earners certainly has its perks, yet such diversions fail to impress Nick. Success to Nick is defined instead by helping those less fortunate and embracing Christianity. Success to his mom is defined differently, through a passion for work, a capitalization on assets, and a drive to accumulate wealth. Convincing his successful mother to follow Jesus' example is nearly impossible, though, since she feels that Jesus is only a myth, immortalized to control the masses. Then fate steps in and Nick finds himself clashing with the obstacles of alcohol, abundance, and adultery as he strives to outrun time and alter fate to present a compelling argument in support of Jesus to the mother he loves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8f7b2940c4169905eb95ad26377d54df7cab8c","amp;dn":"Wayward+Paths+and+Golden+Handcuffs+By+S.J.+Thomason+%5BPDF%5D+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8f7b2940c4169905eb95ad26377d54df7cab8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,143,123,41,64,196,22,153,5,235,149,173,38,55,125,84,223,124,171,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
