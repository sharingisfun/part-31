Of course, Cornel in dub is of course something of an oxymoron, because Cornel is one of the finest singers of his generation, and of course his voice is, by definition, absent from most of this. The riddims shine through though, and where CornelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice does emerge, all is bliss. JRCD033\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n\n1. My Whole Dub Down\n2. Never Let You Dub\n3. General Dub\n4.
