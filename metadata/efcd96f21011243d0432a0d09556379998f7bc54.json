This influence is obvious and crucial at the epistemological level, if only because Kant himself set the frame for subsequent discussion of the difference between human and natural sciences. Yet, KantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work is also rich in substantive contributions to social theory, which may be articulated around his conception of culture and cultural progress.\n\nKey words: culture, civilization, social sciences, unsocial sociability, humaniora","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efcd96f21011243d0432a0d09556379998f7bc54","amp;dn":"Kant%5C%27s+Contribution+to+Social+Theory.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efcd96f21011243d0432a0d09556379998f7bc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,205,150,242,16,17,36,61,4,50,160,208,149,86,55,153,152,247,188,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
