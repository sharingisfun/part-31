The book will highlight the diversity of succulents that occur in the region with special emphasis on the larger groups Ã¢â‚¬â€œmesems (vygies) and aloes.\n\nThe book covers approximately 250 individual species, focusing on the most common and most interesting, and each entry features a photograph and distribution map.\n\n\nBy Gideon F.
