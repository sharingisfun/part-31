What she finds instead is horrifying: a big, burly peasant hanging by a rope from a tree, with a blood-covered axe tucked into his belt. Nearby, she finds a suitcase. \nPacked inside is the body of a dwarf, with a deep head wound caused by an axe.\n\nConventional wisdom says that the peasant killed the dwarf and then, in a paroxysm of guilt and remorse, killed himself. \n\nThat scenario is good enough for everyone but Porfiry.\n\n\nbit rate 48 kbps\n\n\ni'll be seeding in 24 hours from now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f74a2393171912e042fb4eb4ab505a0831b1f9","amp;dn":"gentleax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f74a2393171912e042fb4eb4ab505a0831b1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,247,74,35,147,23,25,18,224,66,251,78,180,171,80,90,8,49,177,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
