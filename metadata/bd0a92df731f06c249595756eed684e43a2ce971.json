Regarded as one of the King's best and noted for the on-screen chemistry between the two singing stars, Viva Las Vegas glistens with musical numbers including the title song - which has become part of pop culture as it personifies everything &quot;Vegas.&quot;\n\nIn one of his most popular movies, Elvis is racecar driver Lucky Jackson who arrives in town with his car literally in tow. In order to enter the first Las Vegas Grand Prix, he must raise enough money to buy a new engine. He gets the cash but loses it when the hotel swimming pool instructor distracts him. Just when it seems he will lose both race and girl, Lady Luck steps in. Veteran director George Sidney guides his two musical talents through songs that include The Lady Loves Me, Appreciation, What I'd Say and of course the title track. \n\nProducer(s):\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² George Sidney\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Jack Cummings\n\nDirector(s):\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² George Sidney\n\nWriter(s):\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Sally Benson\n\nActors:\n ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Elvis Presley ...
