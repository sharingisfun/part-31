Plus, you get 255 Golden Key instead of a measly single one!\n- From the Collector's Edition Pack: Contraband Sky Grenade.\n\n\n\tOther changes (all tested):\n- When opening the loot chest in Sanctuary, you don't loose a Golden Key (but you still need one). Yeah, you can loot that golden chest as often as you want.\n- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish localizations are included.\n- Standalone version: no Steam connection required.\n\n\nLimitations:\n- As this is a standalone version, all functions requiring Steam can't (and won't) work, so: no internet game, no Shift Codes... Don't lament, go buy the game. However, LAN multiplayer games do work (tested between two Macs).\n- LAN games version restrictions still apply: don't mix versions of Borderlands 2, be it PC or Mac.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:debb51027b8159578e648a0ae94e13f9b75f7795","amp;dn":"Borderlands+2+1.3.1+standalone%2BAll+DLCs%2BLocalized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"debb51027b8159578e648a0ae94e13f9b75f7795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,187,81,2,123,129,89,87,142,100,138,10,233,78,19,249,183,95,119,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
