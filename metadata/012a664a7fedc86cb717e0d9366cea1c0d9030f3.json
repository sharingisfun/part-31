Abrams, Inc. | 1993 | ISBN: 0810933764 | English | 92 pages | PDF | 12.8 MB\n\nA book on post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), written especially for young readers. The author tells the story of Gauguin's life and work in a style which should appeal to those encountering the artist for the first time. The reader learns how Gauguin, a successful Paris stockbroker, left his family to sail off to Tahiti on an artistic quest that produced some of the late 19th century's most beautiful and original paintings. Greenfeld conveys a strong sense of Gauguin's personality and leaves the reader with an understanding of his struggle to become an artist of significance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:012a664a7fedc86cb717e0d9366cea1c0d9030f3","amp;dn":"Paul+Gauguin+%28First+Impressions+-+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"012a664a7fedc86cb717e0d9366cea1c0d9030f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,42,102,74,127,237,200,108,183,23,224,217,54,108,234,28,13,144,48,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
