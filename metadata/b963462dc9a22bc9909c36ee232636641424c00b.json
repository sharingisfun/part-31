I will not\nbe using the &quot;high-quality&quot; record to wav then re-encode slowly to \nVBR 128k method but instead live to 128k mp3. I am also going to \ntry to grab Jim Norton's new show this Thursday, but that will go \nup in 64k as it airs on ultra-compressed XM 150.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b963462dc9a22bc9909c36ee232636641424c00b","amp;dn":"Unmasked+2010-05-22-Colin+Quinn+CF64k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b963462dc9a22bc9909c36ee232636641424c00b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,99,70,45,201,162,43,201,144,156,54,238,35,38,54,100,20,36,192,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
