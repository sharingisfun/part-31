The band offered up some heavy jams, with fuzzed out guitar work, spaced out vocals and \n general acid madness.\n &quot;Aguaturbia - Volumen 2\n Prime reissue of one of the most important psychedelic albums to emerge from South America (Chile). Aguaturbia formed in late 1969/ early 1970 around the newly married couple Denise aka New wave singer Clymene Puleghini Solis and talented guitarist Carlos Corales. Informed by concurrent waves of psychedelic blues from America and the UK and equally by earlier surf music and blues the group only cut two albums, but their relevance has endured to this day. 'Volumen 2' is considered, if anything, to be heavier than the first, compared to early Led Zeppelin for heaviness and intensity and seeing the group hit a seriously raw and fuzzed-up groove with spaced out vocals and general acid madness. Check the in-depth sleevenotes for passionate personal recollections of the groups short-lived but momentous career, or just check the music for a full-on wig-out. LP housed in old-style, heavy cardboard tip-on jacket and quality vinyl pressing with wax contained in proper dust sleeve.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7604c398ad35a889091bc4cb8589bc9231d0cf82","amp;dn":"Aguaturbia+%26lrm%3B%2C+Volumen+2+%281971%2F2010%29+24bit%2F96kHz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7604c398ad35a889091bc4cb8589bc9231d0cf82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,4,195,152,173,53,168,137,9,27,196,203,133,137,188,146,49,208,207,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
