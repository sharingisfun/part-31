Excerpts had been performed earlier but the first complete performance in the United States was not given in 1944, by the San Francisco Ballet and choreographed by William Christiansen. Ten years later, George Balanchine choreographed a complete Nutcracker for his New York City Ballet, and from this production, the enormous popularity of the ballet spread.\n\nIn 1959, the New York City Ballet Orchestra, under the direction of Robert Irving, recorded the complete score for Kapp Records. It is a historic recording in many ways, especially for preserving the tempos of the music as Balanchine choreographed it. This is not a Nutcracker for the concert hall. This is a Nutcracker to be danced and the pace is fair livelier than in most other recordings, so much so that, in a few instances, it is difficult to imagine dancers keeping up with it. \n\nKapp Records folded at least 40 years ago and this two LP set went out of print many years before that. (In addition to the set, Kapp also released an LP of two suites from the recording.) But here it is, from a pristine 4-track tape produced for Kapp sometime in the 1960s in full stereo.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d292904f66745c2e6de4a0407642ad6868e0bdd9","amp;dn":"New+York+City+Ballet+Orch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d292904f66745c2e6de4a0407642ad6868e0bdd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,146,144,79,102,116,92,46,109,228,160,64,118,66,173,104,104,224,189,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
