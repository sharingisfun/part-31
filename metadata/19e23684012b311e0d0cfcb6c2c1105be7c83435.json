Nevertheless, the compilation still provides a good introduction for neophyte Clapton fans, especially those that just want copies of his '70s hits. \n -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.I shot the sheriff [04:24] \n 02.After midnight [03:09] \n 03.Knockin' on heaven's door [04:21] \n 04.Wonderful tonight [03:39] \n 05.Layla [07:06] \n (derek and the dominos) \n 06.Cocaine [03:35] \n 07.Lay down sally [03:50] \n 08.Willie and the hand jive [03:28] \n 09.Promises [03:00] \n 10.Swing low sweet chariot [03:29] \n 11.Let it grow [04:56] \n ____ \n \n 44:57 min \n 68,3 MB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e23684012b311e0d0cfcb6c2c1105be7c83435","amp;dn":"Eric_Clapton-Time_Pieces-%28Retail%29-1982-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e23684012b311e0d0cfcb6c2c1105be7c83435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,226,54,132,1,43,49,30,13,12,252,182,194,193,16,91,231,200,52,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
