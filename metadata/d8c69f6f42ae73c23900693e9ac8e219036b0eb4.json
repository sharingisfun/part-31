HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an animal communicator who hires Lucy to find his purrfect mateÃ¢â‚¬â€because his cat told him so.\n\nBut craziest of all is The Beantown Burner, a serial arsonist who is targeting private eye Sam Donahue, the brother of LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend, Sean. With the help of her kooky psychic group, Lucy must tap into abilities she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know she had to catch the firebug before the fires turn deadly. What she never expected to discover is that the motive behind the flames hits a little too close to home...and her heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c69f6f42ae73c23900693e9ac8e219036b0eb4","amp;dn":"Perfectly+Matched+%28Lucy+Valentine%2C+%234%29+-+Heather+Webber.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c69f6f42ae73c23900693e9ac8e219036b0eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,198,159,111,66,174,115,194,57,0,105,62,154,200,226,25,3,107,14,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
