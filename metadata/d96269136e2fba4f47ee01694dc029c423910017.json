In 1951, broke and broken-hearted, Big Bill left for Europe where these sessions were recorded. These tracks comprised his first releases in France and launched a legendary and successful European career. British Groups such as The Rolling Stones, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, The Animals, and Led Zepellin have cited Big Bill as their first taste of the blues. The Tradition reissue of this album includes new comprehensive liner notes [included in torrent]. The mastertapes were sonically cleansed and digitally remastered for this release.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Ridin' On Down\n2. Feelin' Lowdown\n3. Baby Please Don't Go\n4. St. Louis Blues\n5.
