Geographer, as the students immediately dub Sluzhkin, attempts to escape from the grueling, dull, stultifying reality of Russia's provincial life in a rafting tour to the Urals. Accompanied by wild, adventure-seeking adolescents, faced with the numerous grim surprises of the nature, Geographer is poised to find himself and his own truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50c87267623e1e53364d509052e009c8ee67900c","amp;dn":"Geograf.Globus.Propil.2013.BluRay.1080p.DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50c87267623e1e53364d509052e009c8ee67900c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,200,114,103,98,62,30,83,54,77,80,144,82,224,9,200,238,103,144,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
