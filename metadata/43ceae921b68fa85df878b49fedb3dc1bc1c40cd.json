Hoagland's historic presentation on the critical issue of potential &quot;ET artifacts&quot; discovered on the planet Mars made to thousands of government engineers and scientists on March 20, 1990, at the NASA-Lewis Research Center, in Cleveland, Ohio. At the invitation of the center Director himself, Dr. John Klineberg, Hoagland outlines in detail the early findings of the Independent Mars Investigation Team, and their complex, multi-disciplinary analyses of a series of extraordinary, enigmatic photos sent back by NASA's first official &quot;search for life on Mars&quot; -- the 1976 Project Viking Mission.\n\nYou'll see the intensely controversial, official NASA photos themselves as NASA's own engineers first saw them -- images and measurements which demonstrate the extraordinarily redundant, &quot;impossible&quot; mathematical design discovered by Hoagland and his colleagues connecting the enigmatic Martian &quot;Sphinx,&quot; and the nearby &quot;pyramid complex&quot; lying in a northern desert region called &quot;Cydonia&quot; -- left by &quot;someone&quot; very long ago...on the planet Mars. One day (and perhaps, given recent headlines, very soon...) this first official record of a NASA briefing on the Monuments of Mars will be confirmed as valid scientific confirmation of a &quot;high-tech civilization&quot; visiting our solar system...untold millennia ago.\n\nGenre: Lecture \nVideo Codec: DivX 5 \nVideo: ~ 894 kbit/s\nRuntime: 82 Min. \nAudio Format: ~128 kbit/s MP3 VBR  \nFrame Size: 512x384 \nFramerate: 29,970 fps \nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ceae921b68fa85df878b49fedb3dc1bc1c40cd","amp;dn":"Hoagland%5C%27s+Mars+%28Vol.+1%29+-+The+NASA-Cydonia+Briefings+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ceae921b68fa85df878b49fedb3dc1bc1c40cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,206,174,146,27,104,250,133,223,135,139,73,254,219,61,193,188,28,64,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
