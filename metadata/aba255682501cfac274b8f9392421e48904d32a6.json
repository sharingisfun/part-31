NBM Publishing has translated to English and published in the United States issues 1-7; however, NBM Publishing has stated that they will not be publishing the remainder of the series in English in the United States.\n\nThe foreword to the art book 1000 NavÃƒÂ¯s states that the series was conceived at the prompting of publisher Guy Delcourt, who wanted a space opera to add to his catalogue. Jean David Morvan presented the name Sillage to Philippe Buchet, who conceived of the space convoy, but made them entirely alien to avoid comparisons to Battlestar Galactica. Similarly, the main character was made female to avoid comparisons to Tarzan.\n\nThe Wake Civilization is a vast convoy of spacecraft that constantly travel around the galaxy in search of resources, races, and technology. This convoy drops hypergates as it travels, allowing instantaneous access to previously visited star systems. It is unclear whether Wake has any faster than light capability beyond the hypergates. The Wake civilization is very old. There are hints that it has circled the galaxy many times, and revisited many stellar systems over time periods sufficient to watch civilizations rise and fall. There is also evidence that Wake has terraformed planets and seeded life on them over a very long period of time. \n\nWake #1-14 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7587784/Wake_1-14__(JJ__amp_amp__data9724-DCP)_[DCP-D]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7587784/Wake_1-14__(JJ__amp_amp__data9724-DCP)_[DCP-D]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba255682501cfac274b8f9392421e48904d32a6","amp;dn":"Wake+%2315+-+Private+Hunt+%282012%29+%5BDelcourt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba255682501cfac274b8f9392421e48904d32a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,162,85,104,37,1,207,172,39,75,143,147,146,66,30,72,144,77,50,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
