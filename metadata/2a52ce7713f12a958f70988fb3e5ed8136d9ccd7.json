There will be more volumes to follow.\n\nVolume 1\n\nAmber\nHey There\nWhen YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Old\nMarijuana\nPull It Away\nWages Of Sin\nWhere Do You Go At Night?\nSecret Agent\nSay ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Over\nWhen You Think (Fan Challenge)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a52ce7713f12a958f70988fb3e5ed8136d9ccd7","amp;dn":"Gherkin+Off+Volume+1-The+Pickled+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a52ce7713f12a958f70988fb3e5ed8136d9ccd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,82,206,119,19,241,42,149,143,112,152,143,179,229,237,129,54,217,204,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
