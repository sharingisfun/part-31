Rather, he's the newest inmate at the Hoxford Correctional Facility and Mental Institution. He has no hope of release, parole, rehabilitation, or decent conversation. On a good day, he'll tell you he's Zeus and only bite your arm off. Literally. On a bad day, you won't have time to scream to the prison guard for help. But Dr Jessica Ainley, his doctor for five years wants to help Ray and can't understand why the newly privatized, corporately run prison, won't give her access to her patients. And why are people always transferred into Hoxford, but no records show anyone ever transferring back outÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦?\n\nScans by Minutemen's Zone, Locke, DangerPowers &amp; DTsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¼","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc850b38320096332830699756ae778dff95ded5","amp;dn":"Welcome+to+Hoxford+%28Minutemen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc850b38320096332830699756ae778dff95ded5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,133,11,56,50,0,150,51,40,48,105,151,86,174,119,141,255,149,222,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
