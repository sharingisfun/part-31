It is the title track to, and second single from, his 2010 album Bullets in the Gun. The song was released on September 27, 2010 and entered the country music charts at number 37.\n\nMichael Salomon directed the song's music video. It stars Danielle Vasinova and Chad Bannon.\n\nJuli Thanki of The 9513 gave the song a &quot;thumbs up&quot;, saying that Keith's vocals had &quot;nearly tangible bravado&quot;. Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times called the song &quot;cinematic&quot; and compared it to Marty Robbins's &quot;El Paso&quot;. Reviewing for the New York Times, Jon Caramanica called the song &quot;a pumped-up and comically desperate tale&quot; and &quot;almost parodic&quot;.\n\n&quot;Bullets in the Gun&quot; debuted at number 37 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for the week ending October 9, 2010.\n\nBullets in the Gun is the fourteenth studio album from American country artist Toby Keith. It was released in the United States on October 5, 2010 through Show Dog-Universal Music. The album's second single, &quot;Bullets in the Gun&quot;, was sent to radio on September 27, 2010.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on both the US Billboard 200 chart and Top Country albums chart, selling 71,000 copies in its' first week of release. It's the smallest debut at number one since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking the chart in May of 1991. In its second week of release, the album dropped to number nine on the Billboard 200 selling 30,000 copies. In its third week of release, the album fell to number twenty one on the Billboard 200, selling 17,923 copies. As of November 13, the album has sold 138,510 copies in the US.\n\nToby Keith Covel (born July 8, 1961), best known as Toby Keith, is an American country music singer-songwriter, record producer and actor. Keith released his first four studio albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1993's Toby Keith, 1994's Boomtown, 1996's Blue Moon and 1997's Dream Walkin', plus a Greatest Hits package for various divisions of Mercury Records before exiting in 1998. These albums all earned gold or higher certification, and produced several chart singles, including his debut &quot;Should've Been a Cowboy&quot;, which topped the country charts and was the most played country song of the 1990s. The song has received 3 million spins since then, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated.\n\nSigned to Nashville DreamWorks in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single &quot;How Do You Like Me Now?!&quot; that year. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the Number One country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more Number Ones each, and all of the albums were certified multi-platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7931c7d401d482ca7b4875e184387d3f374c5723","amp;dn":"Toby+Keith+-+Bullets+In+The+Gun+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7931c7d401d482ca7b4875e184387d3f374c5723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,49,199,212,1,212,130,202,123,72,117,225,132,56,125,63,55,76,87,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
