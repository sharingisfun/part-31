Although the countries and conflict may not be real, the aircraft and weapons used are completely accurate. The conflict is modeled as a typical Cold War era 'proxy' war between the USA and USSR where Dhimar gets help from the US and Paran uses imported Soviet equipment and expertise.\n\nThird Wire Productions developed the game based on the original Strike Fighters: Project 1 but had to be vastly rewritten to work with the Vista platform. In doing so the latest graphical, Artificial Intelligence, and features were written into the simulation.\n\nIn April 2009, Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam was released, followed in June 2009 by Strike Fighters 2: Europe, and by Strike Fighters 2: Israel in October 2009. Expansion Pack 1 (for Strike Fighters 2: Israel) was released in June 2010 and Expansion Pack 2 (for Strike Fighters 2: Europe) followed on December 1, 2010. All of the games (except the expansion packs) can be installed stand-alone, or they can be merged to make all the stock aircraft available in all games.\n\nNo DRM, so no crack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69daa7d4044d6d12417f1ff1f65876d09e525485","amp;dn":"Strike+Fighters+2+%28All+games+%2B+Expansions+%2B+Campaign+Customizer+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69daa7d4044d6d12417f1ff1f65876d09e525485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,218,167,212,4,77,109,18,65,127,31,241,246,88,118,208,158,82,84,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
