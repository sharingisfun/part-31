Yet again, I apparently assume too much. This is modern\njazz at its best : rhythmic, with strong compositions, clear themes and\nstructure, great arrangements, and above all, a list of top-notch musicians,\nwith Ben Goldberg on clarinet, Sheldon Brown on tenor sax and bass clarinet,\nDevin Hoff on double bass, and Smith Dobson V on drums. Rob Reich joins on\naccordion on the second track, and he fits perfectly to set the tone of the\npiece. The music has a high degree of complexity, in that various orchestrated\nthings can happen at the same time, at different speeds, with several melodies\nbeing interwoven, often with a solo or two on top, and this then changes the\nwhole time, within the same piece. Another great thing about the album is that\ndespite the complexity and the musicians' skills, this music swings, it is\njoyful and exuberant. It swings (&quot;Cabin 5&quot;), it funks (&quot;Broken&quot;), it bops\n(&quot;Apples&quot;), and they improvise through history from old to new and back, there\nare references from Ellingtonian music as much as to Dave Douglas, but in a way,\nI don't think Johnston needs those comparisons. He is a stellar trumpet-player,\nwith a warm tone and a broad range, and these are equalled by his skills as a\ncomposer. Truth be told, I had expected more avant-garde, but he brought a\nsurprise of warm, very creative and captivating modern jazz. And that's a great\nachievement.\n\n--\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31739&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31739&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31675&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Glenn Astarita &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzreview.com/reviews/latest-cd-track-reviews/item/26278-.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzreview.com/reviews/latest-cd-track-reviews/item/26278-.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nDi Giuseppe Segala (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3812&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3812&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor GermÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zaro (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuadernosdejazz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuadernosdejazz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Ricardo Arribas (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzitis.com/web/content/edge-forest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzitis.com/web/content/edge-forest&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/04/06/darren-johnston-the-edge-of-the-forest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/04/06/darren-johnston-the-edge-of-the-forest/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147a2149ec6e4519b46f817083301c473f8b80ad","amp;dn":"Darren+Johnston+-+The+Edge+Of+The+Forest+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147a2149ec6e4519b46f817083301c473f8b80ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,122,33,73,236,110,69,25,180,111,129,112,131,48,28,71,63,139,128,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
