It is the last release by the band to feature their metalcore sound, although more clean vocals are featured on the album than their debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. It is also their only album without any profane language to date. It is also the first album to feature Johnny Christ on bass, thus completeing the band's primary lineup (until The Rev's death in 2009).\n\nTorrent includes:\n\n1.\t&quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;  \t1:42\n2.\t&quot;Unholy Confessions&quot;  \t4:44\n3.\t&quot;Chapter Four&quot;  \t5:43\n4.\t&quot;Remenissions&quot;  \t6:07\n5.\t&quot;Desecrate Through Reverence&quot;  \t5:38\n6.\t&quot;Eternal Rest&quot;  \t5:13\n7.\t&quot;Second Heartbeat&quot;  \t7:00\n8.\t&quot;Radiant Eclipse&quot;  \t6:10\n9.\t&quot;I Won't See You Tonight, Pt. 1&quot;  \t8:58\n10.\t&quot;I Won't See You Tonight, Pt. 2&quot;  \t4:45\n11.\t&quot;Clairvoyant Disease&quot;  \t5:00\n12.\t&quot;And All Things Will End&quot;  \t7:41\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9c104341aaeeb39736c6f56b0325a99ee67d18","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold-+Waking+the+Fallen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9c104341aaeeb39736c6f56b0325a99ee67d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,156,16,67,65,170,238,179,151,54,198,245,107,3,37,169,158,230,125,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
