They've brought different musicians in to the band, changed locations, exchanged equipment, learnt new skills, played and jammed a lot. \n\nNow when Petrus (organ) has been with them for some time, they're feeling stability as a four-piece band. He is both creative and skillful and he brings a new feeling to the music. \n\nSince they started to produce their songs in their own studio, the possibilities for more complex arrangements have increased a lot. \n\nDon't miss this incredible band!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6776683e18ea81a1d3075037d6caa4742ecb168","amp;dn":"First+Band+From+Outer+Space+-+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6776683e18ea81a1d3075037d6caa4742ecb168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,119,102,131,225,142,168,26,29,48,117,3,125,108,170,71,66,236,177,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
