It features High-Res textures in the tomb of Freedon Nadd on the planet Dxun, and the High-Res version of Telos Citadel Station. Also few more textures on other planets that I've missed the first time have been upped.\n\nHi people. For quite a long time I (Cryptobionika, also known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œXenonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) have been working on a patch to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Sith Lords game. I have upped texture resolutions of nearly the entire game, but (!) all the textures used are pure originals. This is NOT a retexture. This is NOT a mod (although several bug-fixing mods were used to complete the patch).\n\nThis is a pure patch that fixes almost every known bug in the game, almost every low-resolution texture and restores some content. This patch will make the game a final version, as Obsidian intended to release it. Many dozens of textures have be upped in resolution, dozens of missing shader effects (metal reflections, etc.) have been restored. All the broken quests have been fixed. Dialogs, scrips sequences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ everything.\n\nThis patch will make your game beautiful (at least as much, as first KOTOR) and bugless. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been working many months on it, and believe me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t regret it.\n\nA team of beta testers have fully checked the patch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there are no conflicts at all. Only conflicts may come out if you use it with some mods or with non-english version. The patch was developed for English version of a game only.\n\nNow, we all know about Team GizkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Restoration project, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we? A very good project indeed. But there is one little thing about it. It DOES NOT fix ANY textures AT ALL. Only content. And the game itself will look as disgusting, as it did.\n\nAlso donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be afraid of viruses (unless uploaded by someone else) because I have no intention of virusing anyone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I was making this patch for myself, so it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a fake of any kind.\n\nIt does not require to be installed on a version 1.0b ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it can be installed on any version.\n\nHere are some screenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8155/01abr4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8155/01abr4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/5241/01bir8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/5241/01bir8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/9317/02aep1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/9317/02aep1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/1628/02buv0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/1628/02buv0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/480/03auf4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/480/03auf4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8417/03bnt1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8417/03bnt1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img165.imageshack.us/img165/9510/04ari3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img165.imageshack.us/img165/9510/04ari3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9013/04bjm3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9013/04bjm3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/5286/05amd7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/5286/05amd7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/7642/05bta0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/7642/05bta0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img523.imageshack.us/img523/6103/06afp1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img523.imageshack.us/img523/6103/06afp1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img165.imageshack.us/img165/1218/06bic5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img165.imageshack.us/img165/1218/06bic5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9530/07aoo9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9530/07aoo9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img120.imageshack.us/img120/3350/07bot7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img120.imageshack.us/img120/3350/07bot7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3361/08apw5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3361/08apw5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/1107/08bsf4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/1107/08bsf4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/9323/09ato9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/9323/09ato9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img120.imageshack.us/img120/4350/09btu1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img120.imageshack.us/img120/4350/09btu1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nALL (well, majority) the other textures in the game have been upped in resolution (and effects, where needed) the same way. That includes droids, rocks, walls, ships, everything.\n\nAnd I would like to ask you: spread this patch anywhere you can, seed it. KOTOR 2 is a great, but very crippled game and thousands of people canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enjoy the game coz of bugs and a terrible look.\n\nThis is and likely will be the only real unofficial patch for this game. Once Gizkas come out with their mod, I will likely work on compatibility.\n\nAnd I will possibly keep on working on the patch. If there will be new releases, they will be sorted by dates, not the builds. The only real thing I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t yet fully fixed (textures) is the Tomb of Freedon Nadd, but it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look all that bad anyway.\n\nWith all the questions and suggestions send me e-mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;debdaca7aeaab1bcb7b1b0b7b5bfeae99ea7bfb6b1b1f0bdb1b3f0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 The Sith Lords Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ Xenon 1.0C (Build 2)\n\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âº:[/b] Xenon \n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™:[/b] www.bioware.ru\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â´Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°:[/b] 2008\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹:[/b] http://www.bioware.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=2187\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬:[/b] Patch\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¯Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âº:[/b] Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°:[/b] PC\n\t\t\n[b]Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â± Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Âµ:[/b] \nÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¿Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã…Â½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¸ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾ Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ÂµÃƒï¿½Ã‚ÂºÃƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â² Star Wars: KotOR II?
