(See below)  I've also included nude packs and made sure that the University schedule bug was fixed before releasing this for everything.  (The bug was where the class schedule was empty and it was caused by a couple store fixes.  I placed the broken &quot;fixes&quot; in a separate directory so that they don't fix your game to a non-working state.)\n\nI also made a nude clothing package that works for everyone and for every clothing option.  Plus, I made sure that all installation content is in ISO format and numbered in the series you need to install it in.  The instructions I wrote will give you a detailed walk through of installing your game so that everything works correctly.\n\nIsland Paradise will be the next expansion and that comes out at the end of June 2013.  You'll probably want to get that one as well.  Also, in fall of 2013, you can grab the &quot;Untitled Futuristic Pack&quot; and in September, the Movie Stuff Pack will be released.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCredits:\n\n\nGames4theworld\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3 - Master Suite Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - Diesel Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - Katy Perry Sweet Treats\nThe Sims 3 - 70s, 80s, &amp; 90s Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - Town Life Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - Seasons\nThe Sims 3 - Supernatural\nThe Sims 3 - Fast Lane Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - University Life\nThe Sims 3 - High End Loft Stuff\nThe Sims 3 - Outdoor Living Stuff\nThe_Sims_3_ultimate_fix.rar\n\n\nViTALITY\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3 - Ambitions\n\n\nRELOADED\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3 - Generations\nThe Sims 3 - World Adventures\nThe Sims 3 - Late Night\n\n\nFairlight\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3 - Showtime\nThe Sims 3 - Pets\n\n\nRazor1911\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3\n\n\nUNKNOWN (If you know who did it, you can comment if you want to.)\n-----------------\nThe Sims 3 - Store Content (From\n\n\nNavetsea\n-----------------\nNude Skins (There are more where these came from at: http://www.insimadult.org/index.php/topic,40129.0.html)\n\n\nvelocitygrass\n-----------------\nvelocitygrass_nomosaic_1_50.package (Makes the blur go away when sims get naked and doesn't take the other wanted special effects away (Ex.

Most\npeople can't afford to pay the rich people to get richer, so that's why\npeople use P2P and help each other.  If you do have the money to pay them\nto get richer, support their development by buying these games.  I do that\nwhen I have the money.  When I can barely afford to eat, I use torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af51cc915c5036faaddc305859f0ce1577f52f14","amp;dn":"Sims+3+All+Expansions+and+Store+Content+5-30-2013+Nude+Patches","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af51cc915c5036faaddc305859f0ce1577f52f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,81,204,145,92,80,54,250,173,220,48,88,89,240,206,21,119,245,47,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
