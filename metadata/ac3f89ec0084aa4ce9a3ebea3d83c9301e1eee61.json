This book captures the magic of Capablanca's early victory at San Sebastian 1911 and his second place - bowing only to Lasker - at St Petersburg 1914. All in all, 35 games are annotated by Capablanca in person with remarkable objectivity - bestowing praise and hurling criticism as and when required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3f89ec0084aa4ce9a3ebea3d83c9301e1eee61","amp;dn":"My+chess+career+%28Jos%26eacute%3B+Ra%26uacute%3Bl+Capablanca%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3f89ec0084aa4ce9a3ebea3d83c9301e1eee61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,63,137,236,0,132,170,76,233,163,235,234,61,131,201,48,30,30,238,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
