They took an unblinking look at the harsh realities of life on the Lower East Side where, for many, it was not Morning in America. 'Domestic Servants' examined the hard times of the working poor; 'Black and Broke' defiantly celebrated sex workers struggling for some dignity; and the song in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clip, 'Tuff Shit', brutally skewered the haves take on the have-nots. Jeff Freund says, 'It was a fantasy came true for me Ã¢â‚¬â€ to take MichaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetry and turn it into credible music. It was real street, he was the articulate punk.'\n\nThe Ballistic Kisses recorded two albums in the UK, 'Total Access' and 'Wet Moment'. David Wojnarowicz, artist and friend of the band, designed the covers. 'The songs were so simple they appealed to peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic instincts,' McClusky said. 'You got fired from your job, well thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tuff Shit. I was very happy that I was able to play music, with words that really meant something to me, that told stories. That was the greatest part, the camaraderie and the message.'Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTrack List:\nA1 Whose Mama Is This 3:50\nA2 Recipe For Revolt 4:02\nA3 Workaholic 3:05\nA4 Five O'Clock World 2:33\nA5 Black And Broke 4:13\nB1 Domestic Servants 3:00\nB2 Body Rhyme 3:58\nB3 Tough Shit 3:48\nB4 Samurai Toys\t2:55\n\nCredits:\nGuitar, Vocals: Jeff Freund\nVocals: Michael Parker\nKeyboard, Vocals: Mike Hrynyk\nDrums, Vocals: Richard McClusky\nCongas: Ricco Espinet\nArranged: Ballistic Kisses\nArtwork: Larry Toth\nProducer: Ballistic Kisses, Iolo Carrew\nProducer, Engineer: Jim Toth\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23960b73f797f44c20797b3223fa2760c882fca6","amp;dn":"Ballistic+Kisses+-+Total+Access+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23960b73f797f44c20797b3223fa2760c882fca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,150,11,115,247,151,244,76,32,121,123,50,35,250,39,96,200,130,252,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
