Crossing the Arctic Circle into Lapland, the Bikers get straight back to basics with the Sami people, who have been cooking this way for centuries. They quickly learn that it's all about keeping it local, fresh and simple. The Samis introduce them to the traditional techniques of smoking to cure meat, manufacturing their own hunting knives and fishing to stock up for the coming winter. Inspired by it all, and with some of the best local ingredients at hand, the bikers treat their hosts to a berry and almond rice pudding and put together their own Nordic reindeer and fish dishes before hitting the road. With a hunger to know more about the traditional life of the reindeer herders, the bikers head deep into the wilderness to meet Lars, one the last surviving forest Sami folk.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/aa/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/The-Hairy-Bikers-Northern-Exposure-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3028 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.31 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b069hr3q","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa8a13a26be78efc33e462324942f4f462ff6c4","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Hairy+Bikers+Northern+Exposure+6of6+South+Sweden+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa8a13a26be78efc33e462324942f4f462ff6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,168,161,58,38,190,120,239,195,62,70,35,36,148,47,79,70,47,246,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
