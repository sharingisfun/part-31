You space monkeys might as well read this so when JJ Abrams completely revamps and fucks up what's left of Star Trek, at least you'll know what his slave screenwriters were thinking beforehand.\n\nThese three issues were found on various places on the internet and are collected here for ease. They were originally scanned by people calling themselves Green Giant and WildBlueZero and they did a nice job. Since the files are in the .CBR format, I have included the installation file for Comical 0.8, which is a .CBR and CBZ file reader (in case you don't already have it).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9363b1250ef313db12a11182c75836a1d1fac6","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Countdown+prequel+comics+parts+1%2C+2%2C+and+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9363b1250ef313db12a11182c75836a1d1fac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,147,99,177,37,14,243,19,219,18,161,17,130,199,88,54,161,209,250,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
