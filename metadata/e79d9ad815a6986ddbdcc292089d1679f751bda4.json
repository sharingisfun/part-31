And you find yourself flying over the desert with Cell, Elea and Hypnotizer, taking a ride to Asia with Shri and Ninbimimi, then on the heights of the Earth with Altitudes (Silicon Sound, Jaia and Blue Planet Corp).\n\nHeading to space with Aes Dana, Slack Baba, Entheogenic and Carbon Based Lifeforms, you dive into the depths of a warm sea with Xavier Fux; then return to sunny beats with Immaculate Ibiza and the hymn, 'Magic Island', by Cell and Elea. This fifth opus in the 'Kumharas Lounge Ibiza' compilation series, permanently establishes the place that has been its inspiration, the Kumharas Bar, among the great names in Balearic chill out today.\n\nA magical mix of dreamy ambients and ethnic beats, this fifth volume of 'Kumharas Lounge Ibiza' takes you high and goes deep inside, incarnating the authentic and original sound that carries Ibiza on its wing. Enjoy...\n\nStyle: Ambient\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79d9ad815a6986ddbdcc292089d1679f751bda4","amp;dn":"Kumharas+lounge+Ibiza+vol.+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79d9ad815a6986ddbdcc292089d1679f751bda4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,157,154,216,21,166,152,109,219,220,194,146,8,157,22,121,247,81,189,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
