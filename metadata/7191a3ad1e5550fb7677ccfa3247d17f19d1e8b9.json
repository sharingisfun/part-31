The first part deals with how the original group turned into Cap's Kooky Quartet, and the second starts right after Vision joined and goes through Wasp and Ant-Man's wedding. A neat mini which I downloaded before, lost, tried to redownload and couldn't find it, and then found on a different drive so I decided to upload. Hope you like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7191a3ad1e5550fb7677ccfa3247d17f19d1e8b9","amp;dn":"Avengers+-+Earth%27s+Mightiest+Heroes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7191a3ad1e5550fb7677ccfa3247d17f19d1e8b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,145,163,173,30,85,80,251,118,119,204,250,50,71,209,127,25,209,232,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
