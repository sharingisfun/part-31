They are all very good and if you're interested in mountain climbing taken to the extreme then you will enjoy these films.  They are about as close as you'll get to actually climbing Mount Everest without leaving your living room.  Two of the DVDs 'Above All Else - The Everest Dream' and 'Everest: The Death Zone' are documentaries recorded high up on the mountain.  Recorded at almost 30,000 feet you can capture the magic of Mount Everest and exactly how big it really is and also how tough it is to climb it and the dangers that you would encounter from going up there.\n\nI have also included a good film all about the accident that happened in 1996 which is now 14 years ago with an expedition that lead to a few climbers losing their lives.  It is an excellent film though not really recorded on Everest but still it is a good story and also a true story which makes it special.\n\nHere are the details for each film, all of them are in NTSC format.  I'm sorry but only the movie has multi languages and subtitles, the others only have English audio but 'Everest: The Death Zone' has English subtitles included.  Each DVD should work in all regions.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbove All Else - The Everest Dream (1999)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Above-All-Else-Everest-Dream/dp/B00004REES&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Above-All-Else-Everest-Dream/dp/B00004REES&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nSize: 3.42 GB\n\nAudio: AC3 5.1 ch/DTS 5-ch/AC3 2-ch - English only\n\nSubtitles: None\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nEverest: The Death Zone (1998)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325332/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325332/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nSize: 3.39 GB\n\nAudio: AC3 2-ch - English only\n\nSubtitles: English only\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nInto Thin Air: Death On Everest (1997)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118949/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118949/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nSize: 3.79 GB\n\nAudio: AC3 2-ch - English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai\n\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHope you enjoy these, they are simply great and you can see all the scenery around the mountain and how truly beautiful it is up there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea5d242372cabea49527d54ec3d13d77d145ecc","amp;dn":"The+Everest+Collection+%5BFull+Size+DVD%5D+%5BNTSC%5D+%5BSpandauBaby%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea5d242372cabea49527d54ec3d13d77d145ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,165,210,66,55,44,171,234,73,82,125,84,236,61,19,215,125,20,94,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
