Clinical chemistry, however, is a topic in which many senior medical students and pathology residents face challenges. Clinical Chemistry, Immunology and Laboratory Quality Control meets this challenge head on with a clear and easy-to-read presentation of core topics and detailed case studies that illustrate the application of clinical chemistry knowledge to everyday patient care.\n\nThis basic primer offers practical examples of how things function in the pathology clinic as well as useful lists, sample questions, and a bullet-point format ideal for quick pre-Board review. While larger textbooks in clinical chemistry provide highly detailed information regarding instrumentation and statistics, this may be too much information for students, residents, and clinicians. This book is designed to educate senior medical students, residents, and fellows, and to &quot;refresh&quot; the knowledge base of practicing clinicians on how tests are performed in their laboratories (i.e., method principles, interferences, and limitations).\n\nTakes a practical and easy-to-read approach to understanding clinical chemistry and toxicology\nCovers all important clinical information found in larger textbooks in a more succinct and easy-to-understand manner\nCovers essential concepts in instrumentation and statistics in such a way that fellows and clinicians understand the methods without having to become specialists in the field\nIncludes chapters on drug-herb interaction and pharmacogenomics, topics not covered by textbooks in the field of clinical chemistry or laboratory medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a71bea987036b07049713c19da363204ada5b6d","amp;dn":"Clinical+Chemistry%2C+Immunology+and+Laboratory+Quality+Control+%5BP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a71bea987036b07049713c19da363204ada5b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,113,190,169,135,3,107,7,4,151,19,193,157,163,99,32,74,218,91,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
