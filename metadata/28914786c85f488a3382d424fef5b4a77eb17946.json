Thus it will exclude magazines such as &quot;The Unspeakable Oath&quot; or &quot;Dagon&quot; as it is quite obvious those magazines cater almost exclusively to players of CoC and its variants.\n\nGenerally what the archive is focused on is publications that are geared to RPGs in general that included CoC material during their run.\n\nThe archive will also not include material that is still available for sale from the publishers at this time ( usually via PDF ) but it will list those articles so users can seek them out themselves.\n\nIf you think this list is missing an article reference or can help with scans for the missing articles then please help. Ideally a scan should include the cover of the magazine the article appeared in and all the pages of the article itself.\nGet in contact via a message below\n\nContents\n--------\nThe archive contains completed collections in PDF form for every CoC-related article ever published in the following magazines:\nAdventurer Magazine - Mersey Leisure UK\nChallenge - GDW\nDragon - TSR US\nImagine - TSR UK\nStarry Wisdom - Chaosium (note: not a scan, but reconstructed)\nWhite Dwarf - Games Workshop UK\n\nIncomplete for the following magazines:\nAdventures Unlimited - Canadian Magazine\nDifferent Worlds - Chaosium\nYe Book of Tentacles\n\nMissing for the following magazines:\nArcane - Future Publishing UK\nAustralian Realms\nFantasy Chronicles - Irish Magazine\nG.M.\nGamesMaster International\nThe Good Games Guide 1 Winter 85-86 - Games Workshop\nLast Province - UK Magazine\nRed Giant Magazine\nRole Player Independent\nUK RPGA's Polyhedron Magazine ( note: not the US version )\nValkyrie\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28914786c85f488a3382d424fef5b4a77eb17946","amp;dn":"The+Call+of+Cthulhu+Article+Archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28914786c85f488a3382d424fef5b4a77eb17946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,145,71,134,200,95,72,138,51,130,212,36,254,245,180,167,126,177,121,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
