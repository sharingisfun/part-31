This is the second volume of\n   a trilogy begun in X'ed Out, and as such has an unfinished feeling.\n   We return to Doug, the protagonist, whose recounting of his\n   relationship with a young woman shifts back and forth between the\n   less surreal of the book's two environments and another where his\n   apparent alter ego works in a dreary factory/hospital providing\n   books to its monster patients. Both scenarios occur in an eerie\n   alternate reality whose visuals exude a sense of uncomfortable,\n   riveting silence that fixes the reader's attention to the tale's\n   odd events. Burns's stark work operates on its own nightmare logic\n   and as a result, flesh-crawling events spew forth in the most\n   mundane of settings. Romance comics, misshapen mutants, reptile\n   men, a nightmare of disembowelment that yields a fetal pig,\n   photographic obsessions and more stake out their territory Ã¢â‚¬â€ the\n   result will stick with readers long after being absorbed. &quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4599934c1e631367cccb8f9a7f55f87bcad2c5e3","amp;dn":"Charles+Burns%3A+The+Hive+%28Random+House%29+%282012%29+%28GN%29+-+%28invisifan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4599934c1e631367cccb8f9a7f55f87bcad2c5e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,153,147,76,30,99,19,103,204,203,143,154,127,85,248,123,202,210,197,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
