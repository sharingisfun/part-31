Scam. Heâ€™s got a voice inside him thatâ€™ll say whatever you want to hear, whether itâ€™s true or not. Which is handy, except when it isnâ€™tâ€”like when the voice starts gabbing in the middle of a bank robbery. The only people who can help are the other Zeroes, who arenâ€™t exactly best friends these days.\r\n\r\nEnter Nate, a.k.a. Bellwether, the groupâ€™s â€œglorious leader.â€ After Scamâ€™s SOS, he pulls the scattered Zeroes back together. But when the recue blows up in their faces, the Zeroes find themselves propelled into whirlwind encounters with ever more dangerous criminals. At the heart of the chaos they find Kelsie, who can take a crowd in the palm of her hand and tame it or let it loose as she pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Amber Benson\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ead8891b13fb30154e4f2fc9454a3fa7bc74f1","amp;dn":"Scott+Westerfeld+-+Zeroes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ead8891b13fb30154e4f2fc9454a3fa7bc74f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,234,216,137,27,19,251,48,21,78,79,47,201,69,74,63,167,188,116,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
