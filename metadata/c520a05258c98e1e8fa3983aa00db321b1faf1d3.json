Great\n   summer record. Buy it Tuesday.\n\n   &quot;Mesa, AZ based punk rock royalty Authority Zero returns with the release of \n   their fourth studio album, Stories of Survival. Founded in the summer of \n   1994, the band has flourished for nearly two decades.\n\n   Lava Records signed Authority Zero for the release of their iconic 2002 debut \n   album A Passage In Time . The album drew comparisons to Bad Religion and \n   Sublime and toured with Sum 41 and on the Warped Tour. They released their \n   sophomore effort Andiamo in 2004. The album embraced more ska and reggae \n   influences paired with Latin-flavored rhythms to create their most culturally \n   diverse record to date.\n\n   Authority Zero then released two other well received releases, a live album \n   titled Rhythm and Booze and 2007 s 12:34 . Incredibly successful tours \n   alongside Regab, Pennywise and Pepper followed these releases before the \n   band returned to the studio to begin crafting this new release.&quot;\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
