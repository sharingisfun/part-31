The extra inclusions are virtually each track from the first three Plug singles (recorded before the album and originally released on Rising High). The material from the EPs is quite similar to and definitely up to the level of the LP's quality, perhaps concentrating more on Vibert's experimental streak and his roots in hip-hop. There are a few more old-school vocal samples, downtempo breakdowns in the middle of tracks, and even more of a focus on production than on the original Drum'n'Bass for Papa.
