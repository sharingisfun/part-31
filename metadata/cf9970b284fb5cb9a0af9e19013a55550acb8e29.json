I had my life all planned out for me. Play football in college. Go to the NFL. Marry my high school sweetheart and live happily ever after. \nI broke both our hearts that day when I told her I was leaving. I was young. I made the right decision for me, but the wrong decision for us. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve poured my soul into my music, but I've never forgotten her. Her smell, her smile. And now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going back. After ten years. I hope I can explain that after all this time. I still want her to be my forever girl. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9970b284fb5cb9a0af9e19013a55550acb8e29","amp;dn":"Forever+My+Girl+%28The+Beaumont+Series%29+by+Heidi+McLaughlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9970b284fb5cb9a0af9e19013a55550acb8e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,153,112,178,132,251,92,185,160,175,158,25,1,58,85,85,10,203,142,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
