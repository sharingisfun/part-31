They recorded numerous singles and albums and achieved vast regional popularity, but only scored one modest national hit, &quot;Baja.&quot; With little material of their own, they judiciously tapped heavyweights like Lee Hazelwood (who wrote &quot;Baja&quot;), Roger Christian, and Gary Usher, as well as covering tunes by Dick Dale and Henry Mancini. The group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.\n\nTaken From: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nCollectables' single disc release of Competition Coupe/Orbit Campus collects two 1964 albums from the Astronauts. Competition Coupe was the Astronauts' attempt at a hot rod album and its surprisingly enjoyable. There's not many classic hot rod songs -- &quot;Our Car Club&quot; comes the closest -- but it's a speedy, trashy delight with such songs as &quot;The Hearse,&quot; &quot;Devil Driver's Theme,&quot; &quot;Happy Ho-Daddy,&quot; &quot;Devil Driver,&quot; &quot;Chevy Scarfer,&quot; &quot;El Aguila,&quot; 4:56 Stingray&quot; and &quot;650 Scrambler.&quot; Orbit Campus is the Astronauts' take on frat-rock classics, which means there's a bunch of rock &amp; roll oldies -- &quot;Johnny B. Goode,&quot; &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lu-La,&quot; &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly,&quot; &quot;Bony Moronie,&quot; &quot;Roll Over Beethoven,&quot; etc. -- plus the odd collegiate folk song like &quot;Greenback Dollar.&quot; The end result is a fun, if unremarkable, rock &amp; roll record, much like this single-disc compilation.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9fwxqyjldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9fwxqyjldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEntries for the individual albums exist, but they lack reviews:\nCompetition Coupe: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3pftxq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3pftxq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\nAstronauts Orbit Kampus: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wpfrxq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wpfrxq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
