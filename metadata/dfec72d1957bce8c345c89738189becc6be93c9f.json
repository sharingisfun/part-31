He looks at whether it is too late to save their remarkable biodiversity.\nHorizon travels from the cold waters of the North Atlantic to the tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef to meet the scientists who are transforming our understanding of this unique habitat. Attenborough explores some of the ways in which we are affecting marine life - from over-fishing to the acidification of sea water.\nThe film also uncovers the disturbing story of how shipping noise is deafening whales and dolphins, affecting their survival in the future.\n\nDuration: 58:58\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVcodec:    XviD 2pass MPEG\nAcodec:    AC3 192kbps/2ch\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfec72d1957bce8c345c89738189becc6be93c9f","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+Death+of+the+oceans+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfec72d1957bce8c345c89738189becc6be93c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,236,114,209,149,123,206,140,52,92,137,115,129,137,190,204,107,233,60,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
