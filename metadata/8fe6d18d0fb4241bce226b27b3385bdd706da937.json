What has been published in the past deals mainly with material in Italy and the Latin West. There is a particular demand for a book on Roman art in the nations and provinces east of the Adriatic Sea. &quot;The broad nature of Roman art is well known. Artistic developments from the Early Republic to Late Antiquity have been studied on a general basis and on the basis of trends in the provinces, influences on the main current of Greco-Roman classicism, and the emergence of new vocabularies in the later third century a.d. Still, the emphasis has always been on Rome and Italy as the hub of Roman Republican and imperial art.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe6d18d0fb4241bce226b27b3385bdd706da937","amp;dn":"Roman+Imperial+Art+in+Greece+and+Asia+Minor+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe6d18d0fb4241bce226b27b3385bdd706da937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,230,209,141,15,180,36,27,206,34,107,39,179,56,91,221,112,109,169,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
