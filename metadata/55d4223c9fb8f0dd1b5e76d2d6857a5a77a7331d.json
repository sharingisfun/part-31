Teamed with tenor-saxophonist Johnny Griffin and the Three Sounds (the popular soul jazz rhythm section comprised of pianist Gene Harris, bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy), Nat is in excellent form on such tunes as &quot;Well You Needn't,&quot; &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore&quot; and &quot;I Never Knew&quot; in addition to two of his lesser-known originals. Adderley and Griffin made for an exciting frontline.
