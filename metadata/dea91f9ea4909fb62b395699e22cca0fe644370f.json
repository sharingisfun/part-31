Advanced solutions (i.e., those based on recent research results) to the four fundamental problems of modeling, identification, control and fault diagnosis for batch processes are developed in detail in four distinct chapters. In each chapter, a general overview of foundational concepts is also given, together with a review of recent and classical literature on the various subjects.\n\nTo provide a unitary treatment of the different topics and give a firm link to the underlying practical applications, a single case study is developed as the book progresses; a batch process of industrial interest, i.e., the phenol-formaldehyde reaction for the production of phenolic resins, is adopted to test the various techniques developed. In this way, a roadmap of the solutions to fundamental problems, ranging from the early stages of the production process to the complete design of control and diagnosis systems, is provided for both industrial practitioners and academic researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea91f9ea4909fb62b395699e22cca0fe644370f","amp;dn":"Control+and+Monitoring+of+Chemical+Batch+Reactors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea91f9ea4909fb62b395699e22cca0fe644370f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,169,31,158,164,144,159,182,43,57,86,153,226,44,202,15,230,68,55,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
