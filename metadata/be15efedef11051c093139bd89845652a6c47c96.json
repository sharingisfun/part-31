This second edition is completely updated and expanded, and now comprises new chapters on spin electronics and quantum information processing, transport in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, organic/molecular electronics, and applications of field effect transistors. The book also provides an overview of semiconductor processing technologies and experimental techniques. With a number of examples and problems with solutions, this is an ideal introduction for students and beginning researchers in the field.\r\n\r\n&quot;This book is a useful tool, too, for the experienced researcher to get a summary of recent developments in solid state nanostructures. I applaud the author for a marvellous contribution to the scientific community of mesoscopic electronics.&quot;\r\nProf. K.
