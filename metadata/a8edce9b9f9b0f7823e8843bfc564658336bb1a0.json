The Complete EmArcy Recordings\n10 CD box set + 1 bonus disc\n\nAlthough undoubtedly an expensive acquisition, this ten-CD set is perfectly done and contains dozens of gems. The remarkable but short-lived trumpeter Clifford Brown has the second half of his career fully documented (other than his final performance) and he is showcased in a wide variety of settings. The bulk of the numbers are of Brownie's quintet with co-leader and drummer Max Roach, either Harold Land or Sonny Rollins on tenor, pianist Richie Powell, and bassist George Morrow (including some previously unheard alternate takes), but there is also much more. Brown stars at several jam sessions (including a meeting with fellow trumpeters Clark Terry and Maynard Ferguson), accompanies such singers as Dinah Washington, Helen Merrill, and Sarah Vaughan, and is backed by strings on one date. Everything is here, including classic versions of &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare,&quot; &quot;Joy Spring,&quot; &quot;Daahoud,&quot; &quot;Coronado,&quot; a ridiculously fast &quot;Move,&quot; &quot;Portrait of Jenny,&quot; &quot;Cherokee,&quot; &quot;Sandu,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember April,&quot; and &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot; Get this set while it stays in print. (AllMusic)\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8edce9b9f9b0f7823e8843bfc564658336bb1a0","amp;dn":"Clifford+Brown+-+1989+-+Brownie.+The+Complete+EmArcy+Recordings+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8edce9b9f9b0f7823e8843bfc564658336bb1a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,237,206,155,159,155,15,120,35,232,132,59,252,86,70,88,51,107,177,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
