The dated Q Class was seen as an obvious, but the SRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid, decided a new class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives was a much better replacement, using minimal resources due to wartime austerity and to reduce weight. \n\nBuilt by SRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brighton and Ashford Works, the Q1 ClassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unique design saw it labelled with some less than favourable nicknames, however its lightweight construction meant it could operate across the majority of the Southern network, and it was even used occasionally on passenger services. The Q1 Class adequately met the Southern RailwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wartime requirements and many of the Class continued into the post-war BR era, working over the Southern Region until the end of steam in the mid-1960s. \n\nAll but one of the Class were scrapped; the first locomotive built in the Class was preserved and ran until 2004 at the Bluebell Railway in West Sussex. It can now be seen on static display at the National Railway Museum in York, England. \n\nThe Bulleid Q1 Class for Train Simulator is available in Southern and BR liveries, with pre- and post-1956 BR logos. Extensive detailing of the model includes three driving modes, dynamic numbering including optional fittings for all members of the class, multiple cab views, fully modelled and animated StephensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gear, realistic wheel slip physic and effects, cylinder cock management, realistic injector control, fully controllable steam sander, working tender controls and dynamic head disc/lamp settings. \n\nAlso included are a selection of World War II era wagons, including SR single conflats with containers, SR double conflats with loads including Spitfire fuselage, gun barrels, tree trunks and planks, Howitzer Railgun and SR Warwell with Cromwell tank.
