He's sharing a house with his best (and only) friend, Tom (Tom Ward), his dog, John, and Tom's rabbit, $haniqua, and he's doing adult things like cooking roast chickens and eating asparagus.\n\nBut the events of one day throw his world into chaos. He's dumped by his girlfriend, Claire (Caitlin Stasey), and introduced to a decidedly odd but very attractive man, Geoffrey (Wade Briggs).\n\nBased on the award-winning comedy of Josh Thomas, the six-part series PLEASE LIKE ME is about cavoodles, custard tarts, boyfriends and girlfriends. Mostly, though, it's about growing up quickly and realising that your parents are not heroes, but big dopes with no idea what's going on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just like you.\n\nDuration: 00:28:02, bitrate: 503 kb/s\nVideo: h264 (Constrained Baseline) (avc1), 512x288 [16:9], 400 kb/s, 25 fps\nAudio: aac (mp4a), 44100 Hz, stereo, s16, 96 kb/s\n\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/F9saIyS.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c42591d29a4773c98f2f79ff24109ffac70f645","amp;dn":"Please+Like+Me+S01E01+WEB-DL+H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c42591d29a4773c98f2f79ff24109ffac70f645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,66,89,29,41,164,119,60,152,242,247,159,242,65,9,255,172,112,246,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
