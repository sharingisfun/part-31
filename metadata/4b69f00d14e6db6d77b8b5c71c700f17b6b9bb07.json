When a group of hard-luck teens in Motor City stumble upon a street drug called MPH, they gain the power of super speed. Will they use it to save the world? Hell no! Not when there's dolla, dolla bills to be had, y'all. A high-octane urban adventure, MPH brings you super speed like you've never seen before!\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b69f00d14e6db6d77b8b5c71c700f17b6b9bb07","amp;dn":"MPH+01+%282014%29+%284+cvrs+1440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29+%5BNV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b69f00d14e6db6d77b8b5c71c700f17b6b9bb07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,105,240,13,20,230,219,109,119,184,181,199,28,112,15,23,182,185,187,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
