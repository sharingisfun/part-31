When her paternal grandmother (Academy AwardÃ‚Â® winner Octavia Spencer) seeks custody with the help of her brother (Anthony Mackie), the little girl is torn between two families who love her deeply. With the best intentions at heart, both families fight for what they feel is right and are soon forced to confront their true feelings about race, forgiveness, and understanding. Anchored by an all-star cast and based on real events, the movie is a look at two seemingly different worlds, in which nothing is as simple as black or white.\n\nDirector: Mike Binder\n\nWriters: Mike Binder\n\nActors: Kevin Costner, Octavia Spencer, Jillian Estell, Bill Burr, Jennifer Ehle, AndrÃƒÂ© Holland, Gillian Jacobs, Anthony Mackie\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 1 minute","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20615cea5bed03800ce4cc93bc8c65f91e63da2","amp;dn":"Black+or+White.+Official+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20615cea5bed03800ce4cc93bc8c65f91e63da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,6,21,206,165,190,208,56,0,206,76,201,59,200,198,95,145,230,61,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
