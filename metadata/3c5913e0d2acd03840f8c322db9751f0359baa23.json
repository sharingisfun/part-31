It gave Fassbinder an opportunity to indulge his passion for working with women - there are forty women in the play and no men.\nThe play dates from the 1930s, and Fassbinder was accused by the critics of being anti-women (a frequent criticism of late). As usual, he chose to work &quot;against&quot; the text, and from this has constructed an entertaining and engaging play about love between upper-class women with nothing better to do than sneer at others when things go wrong with their lives and loves.\n(the above was taken from the appendix Filmography in: Fassbinder. Edited by Tony Rayns. Revised and expanded edition. bfi, London 1980, page 115)\n\n__________________________________\n\n\nFormat: avi\nSource: TVRip\nVideo: 480 x 384, DAR 1.250 (5:4), 25.000 fps, DivX 5.x/6.x, 1151 kbps, Qf 0.250\nAudio: [de] 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3, 44100Hz 128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo \nSize: 1,023 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5913e0d2acd03840f8c322db9751f0359baa23","amp;dn":"Frauen+in+New+York+%28Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder%2C+1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5913e0d2acd03840f8c322db9751f0359baa23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,89,19,224,210,172,208,56,64,248,195,34,219,151,81,240,53,155,170,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
