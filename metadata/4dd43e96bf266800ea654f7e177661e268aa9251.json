Released late in 1974, it featured Patrick Simmons on lead vocals.\n\nIntroducing a bluegrass sound to traditional rock, &quot;Black Water&quot; hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1975. The song was originally released as the B-side to &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday,&quot; but became the more popular song.\n\nThe song is characterized by the melodious a cappella section, with lyrics that are perhaps the most well-known in the entire song: &quot;I&amp;#039;d like to hear some funky Dixieland/Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd43e96bf266800ea654f7e177661e268aa9251","amp;dn":"The+Doobie+Brothers+-+Black+Water","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd43e96bf266800ea654f7e177661e268aa9251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,212,62,150,191,38,104,0,234,101,79,126,23,118,97,226,104,170,146,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
