It assumes no prior knowledge of chemistry, and makes your course an engaging and positive experience by relating the structure and behavior of matter to its role in health and the environment. The Eleventh Edition introduces more problem-solving strategies, including new concept checks, more problem-solving guides, and more conceptual, challenge, and combined problems. \n\nTitle: Chemistry.
