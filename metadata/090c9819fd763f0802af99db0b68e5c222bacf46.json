Using a start-to-finish case study and extensive Java example code, De Jonge covers the entire lifecycle, from application design and data modeling through security, testing, and deployment.\n\nDe Jonge introduces breakthrough techniques for creating applications that respond within two seconds, even on cold startup, and allow server responses in hundreds of milliseconds or less throughout the rest of the session. He also demonstrates how to avoid common mistakes that can dramatically reduce cloud application performance and scalability. He thoroughly covers state-of-the-art user interface development and shows how to make the most of Google App EngineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extensive set of APIs. Coverage includes\n\nSetting up a development environment that makes it easy to continually address performance\nUnderstanding the anatomy of a Google App Engine application\nMaking the right technical setup and design choices for each new application\nEfficiently modeling data for App EngineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s NoSQL data storage\nRecognizing when to avoid OR-mapping and pass datastore entities directly to HTML templates\nFinding alternatives to frameworks and libraries that impair App Engine performance\nUsing JavaScript and AJAX on the client side of your cloud applications\nImproving browser performance and reducing resource consumption via better use of HTML5 and CSS3\nTaking advantage of key App Engine APIs: datastore, blobstore, mail, task scheduling, memory caching, URL retrieval, and messaging\nSecuring cloud-based Web applications with Google Accounts, OpenID, and OAuth\nImproving your cloud development, quality assurance, and deployment processes\nTargeting, marketing, and selling cloud solutions, from planning to payment handling\nBook Details\nPaperback: 352 pages\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional (October 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 032174263X\nISBN-13: 978-0321742636","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090c9819fd763f0802af99db0b68e5c222bacf46","amp;dn":"Addison.Wesley.Essential.App.Engine.Oct.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090c9819fd763f0802af99db0b68e5c222bacf46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,12,152,25,253,118,63,8,2,175,153,219,11,104,229,194,34,186,207,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
