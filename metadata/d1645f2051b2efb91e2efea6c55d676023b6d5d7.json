M. LennÃƒÂ©, David Wood - Agrobiodiversity Management for Food Security: A Critical Review\nPublished: 2011-05 | ISBN: 1845937619 | PDF | 256 pages | 3 MB\n\n\nAgrobiodiversity provides most of our food through our interaction with crops and domestic animals. Future global food security is firmly anchored in sound, science-based management of agrobiodiversity. This book presents key concepts of agrobiodiversity management, critically reviewing important current and emerging issues including agricultural development, crop introduction, practical diversity in farming systems, impact of modern crop varieties and GM crops, conservation, climate change, food sovereignty and policies. It will also address claims and misinformation in the subject based on sound scientific principles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1645f2051b2efb91e2efea6c55d676023b6d5d7","amp;dn":"Agrobiodiversity+Management+for+Food+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1645f2051b2efb91e2efea6c55d676023b6d5d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,100,95,32,81,178,239,185,30,46,254,166,197,93,103,96,35,182,213,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
