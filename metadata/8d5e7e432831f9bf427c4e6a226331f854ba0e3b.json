The new version added SOLVER to solve the problems of dynamics of solids, the combined FEA / MBD-the analysis of deformable and rigid bodies, the 3D visualization of the results HyperGraph 3D, specialized graphical interfaces for different manufacturing processes (stamping, forging, welding, extrusion and casting) and much more. As part of CAE-Driven Design Process developed new optimization procedure, implemented in the program OptiStruct (stress-constrained topology, topography, structural, shape and size optimization.\n\nModules:\n\nHyperMesh\n- Module of input data, splitting patterns, use of materials etc.\nRuns fast and high-quality splitting the original model.\nIt can be run in different &quot;environments&quot; for different solver.\n\nHyperCrash\n- The module for calculating the dynamic impact and collisions.\n\nOptiStruct and RADIOSS\n- The structural solver and nonlinear problems. Can be run from a shell or separately.\n\nHyperView and HyperView Player\n- The module visualization and postprocessing.\n\nHyperStudy and HyperStudy DSS\n- Module Implementation and optimization of multi-analysis.\n\nHyperGraph and HyperGraph 3D\n- Postprocessors with great potential.\n\nMotionView and MotionSolve\n- Viewer and solver for problems of kinematics and dynamics.\nFully compatible (directly or inversely) with MSC.ADAMS, ADM is able to cheat and ACF files from ADAMS!\n\nBatchMesher\n- Avtorazbienie and support assemblies. Written in Java.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5e7e432831f9bf427c4e6a226331f854ba0e3b","amp;dn":"Altair+HyperWorks+11.0.0.47+Win%26amp%3BLinux+x32%26amp%3Bx64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5e7e432831f9bf427c4e6a226331f854ba0e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,94,126,67,40,49,249,191,66,124,78,106,34,99,49,248,84,186,14,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
