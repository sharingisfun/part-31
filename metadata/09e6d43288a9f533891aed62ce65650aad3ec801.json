Just how deadly is the Bermuda Triangle? And what&amp;#039;s the real story behind all those alien abductions? The answers to these and many other questions lie within the covers of The Skeptic&amp;#039;s Guide to the Paranormal. Guaranteed to liven up any dinner party, this delightful, highly readable book offers color photographs and scientific case-by-case explanations for twenty-seven phenomena that appear to defy known science, including ghosts and poltergeists, the predictions of Nostradamus, and yogic levitation, among many others. Speaking directly to the reader, and always with respect for those who believe, Kelly gives us a bite-size, nonacademic approach to debunking hugely popular superstitions and mysteries. Did you know that you, too, can bend spoons and read minds? This book will show you how.\n\n272 pages \nPublisher: Basic Books(March 10, 2005) \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e6d43288a9f533891aed62ce65650aad3ec801","amp;dn":"Skeptic%5C%27s+Guide+to+the+Paranormal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e6d43288a9f533891aed62ce65650aad3ec801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,230,212,50,136,169,245,51,137,26,237,98,206,101,101,10,173,62,200,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
