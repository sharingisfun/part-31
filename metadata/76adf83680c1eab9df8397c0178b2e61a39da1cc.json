As if to counter the new pope with a healthy dose of American ignorance and bigotry, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether or not corporate personhood extends to having the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœreligious freedomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to ignore labor law, and the rightwing Catholic League has launched a crusade against Bill Maher over comments made by gay advocate Dan Savage... plus a ridiculous list of other utterances that have gotten their collective panties in a wad.\n\nMeanwhile, organizers expect about 1,500 Black Friday Walmart protests across the country this year, the IRS eyes limiting the role of political nonprofits, Lara LoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bogus Benghazi story earns her a timeout, and Alec Baldwin sounds off about parting company with MSNBC.\n\nNicoleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guests include: Robert Lamarche of Advocates for Children and Families... November is National Adoption Month, something Nicole and her adopted daughter feel very thankful for. Forbes.comÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rick Unger will explain how the IRS is trying to rein in the 501(c)(4)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. Ã¢â‚¬ËœMoral MondaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pioneer and the president of the North Carolina NAACP Rev. Dr .William Barber II on achieving change through activism. And SalonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Josh Eidelson will cover the War on Thanksgiving and why Bernie Sanders is talking about running for president in 2016.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76adf83680c1eab9df8397c0178b2e61a39da1cc","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+with+Nicole+Sandler+-+November+27+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76adf83680c1eab9df8397c0178b2e61a39da1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,173,248,54,128,193,234,185,223,131,151,192,23,139,46,97,163,157,161,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
