After serving his time with the band, he decided to make his own mark in the music, as solo act. To me, Johnny has a gift so rare, a fantastic singer, song writer and a great guitar player, what a combination! We had not been in touch for about 15 years, each doing our own thing. One day out of the blue Johnny phoned. We met shortly after the call and we put some songs together. Then a little tour, as a duo was set up for spring 2008. It was a simple as that, like riding a bike ...straight back to our roots. This is a live recording from that tour. No overdubbing, no mixing, just straight from the desk...&amp; the heart....enjoy!..' ~~ by Paul Lamb, December 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0609d54fc63fa8c7e22ed098be4cb82910d8c8","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Johnny+Dickinson+%26+Paul+Lamb+-+Playin%5C%27+With+The+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0609d54fc63fa8c7e22ed098be4cb82910d8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,6,9,213,79,198,63,168,199,226,46,208,152,190,76,184,41,16,216,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
