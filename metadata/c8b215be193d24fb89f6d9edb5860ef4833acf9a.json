They were not solely responsible for devising folk-rock, but they were certainly more responsible than any other single act (Dylan included) for melding the innovations and energy of the British Invasion with the best lyrical and musical elements of contemporary folk music. The jangling, 12-string guitar sound of leader Roger McGuinn's Rickenbacker was permanently absorbed into the vocabulary of rock. They also played a vital role in pioneering psychedelic rock and country-rock, the unifying element being their angelic harmonies and restless eclecticism. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifqxqw5ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifqxqw5ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe Byrds were musical pioneers and a great album-producing band, but they were also masters of the form in terms of singles. At the time of the Byrds' formation, singles were still king, and it was the only way for a band to make an impact. The Byrds put out singles from the start with &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; a consciousness-raising track recorded in late 1964. Aside from the incredible fusion of folk and rock, Original Singles, Vol. 1 (1965-1967) has a real sound to it. Part of this has to do with producer Terry Melcher's excellent production -- blending the Beach Boys' &quot;Don't Worry, Baby&quot; with elements of the Beatles. Through tracks like &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn,&quot; &quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better,&quot; &quot;Eight Miles High,&quot; &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star,&quot; and numerous others -- including B-sides -- the Byrds showed themselves able to encapsulate their complete musical direction in two hit singles. A rare feat indeed.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gzftxqq5ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gzftxqq5ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe album is listed here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000025N9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000025N9&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
