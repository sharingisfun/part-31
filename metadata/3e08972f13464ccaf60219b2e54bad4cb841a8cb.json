It also explores the nature of relationships within and between species, describes their everyday lives, and discusses how isolated individuals became members of larger social groups. \r\n\r\nThe concluding chapters highlight the paramount importance of the emergence of symbolic thought and discuss its contribution to the formation of institutions, societies, and economies. The multifaceted picture that emerges will help the reader to make sense not only of â€œwhat we wereâ€, but also of â€œwhat we areâ€, here and now. \r\n\r\nThe book is both entertaining and rigorous in integrating results from a wide selection of disciplines. It will be particularly suitable for people with a curious and open mind, keen to overcome long-standing prejudices on man's place in nature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e08972f13464ccaf60219b2e54bad4cb841a8cb","amp;dn":"Humans+-+An+Unauthorized+Biography+-+1st+Ed+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e08972f13464ccaf60219b2e54bad4cb841a8cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,8,151,47,19,70,76,202,246,2,25,178,229,75,173,76,184,65,168,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
