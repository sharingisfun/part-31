But in recent years, American historical writing has re?ected a heightened search for inclusiveness to better acknowledge and comprehend that diversity. The Dictionary originally focused on political and military history, re?ecting the discipline?s chief concerns at the time. But today we talk about ?political culture,? not just politics. Political history is not just about compiling electoral results or noting the passage of laws or programs. The social, cultural, and economic forces that propel political agendas are very much with in its scope. The new Dictionary of American History therefore devotes proper attention to the roles of women, blacks, Indians, and various ethnic groups and socioeconomic classes. We recognize that we cannot discuss slavery, the struggle for civil rights, or poverty without noting the agency of blacks themselves, as instigators of change. And we cannot discuss industrialization and labor in America without considering the women ? New England mill girls , immigrant workers in the needle trades, ?career girl? clerks ?whose actions and experiences are vital to understanding these processes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:137da6e8b4cbc88522dfbcb86d1e2086aa28b8fd","amp;dn":"DICTIONARY+OF+AMERICAN+HISTORY+3rd+EDITION.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"137da6e8b4cbc88522dfbcb86d1e2086aa28b8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,125,166,232,180,203,200,133,34,223,188,184,109,30,32,134,170,40,184,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
