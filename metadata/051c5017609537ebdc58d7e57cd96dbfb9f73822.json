Click Play Offline.\n\nI\\'ve been thinking of making this self-extracting, but that\\'d be too easy for you.\n\nThere aren't as many mods in this release as in the last one. Single Player Commands isn't coming out for a few weeks (until the bug fixes finish)\n\nIf you like it, buy it. Seriously.\n\nI\\'ll seed as long as I can, or get it off Dropbox and put it in your torrent downloads folder. The link is in the feed in the torrent comments.\n\nMany thanks to the Mojang and the mod developers. Sorry for distributing :)\n\nSubscribe to the MCPortable RSS feed.
