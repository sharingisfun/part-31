David Pulkingham\n# Jay Dee on accordion\n\n\nGreat Artwork by G the Cock included!\n\n\nAnother fun New Years Eve with Patti and the band, and a couple of her family members as special guests. Patti makes a crack about this, as she introduces sister Kimberly and sings a bit of Sly Stone&amp;#039;s &quot;Family Affair&quot;. But it&amp;#039;s all good, because she doesn&amp;#039;t have to pay &amp;#039;em and that leaves her more money to buy caviar (this will be explained during the show) :D\n\nFinally, on this night, she brings the show opener Alejandro Escovedo onstage for a few songs, most notably a duet on Bob Dylan&amp;#039;s &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;. It&amp;#039;s still ragged and beautiful, though maybe not as dramatic as the original duets with Dylan on the 1995 tour.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s a great Video on YouTube of the Patti/Dylan version:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqwOh5gYTM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ZqwOh5gYTM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand if you leave a comment, Patti just may read it, as she talks about this after the song.\n\nAnyway, enough already. Please enjoy this audience version. The &quot;other&quot; version is forthcoming as well. This audience recording gives a better idea of how it actually sounded in the Bowery on this night, but if ya just want the radio show, I guess you&amp;#039;ll have to wait a day or so.\n\nThanks to everyone who made this possible, and to Patti &amp; the band for the awesome shows.\nAlways share this freely- not for profit, and support all these fine musicians. Patti just put out a new album on itunes today, so please do the right thing and BUY it. ;-)\n\nAlso, we would appreciate if this is converted to MP3 ONLY for personal use. Not put on someone&amp;#039;s fucking website as an MP3 download. I&amp;#039;m talking to YOU, Big O!\n\n\n\nPeace, Y&amp;#039;all and Happy New Year!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0085cf2a331f8daddc4058f3da85f00e61d5b5","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+2007-12-31+Bowery+Ballroom+NYC++DAUD+%28.flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0085cf2a331f8daddc4058f3da85f00e61d5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,0,133,207,42,51,31,141,173,220,64,88,243,218,133,240,14,97,213,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
