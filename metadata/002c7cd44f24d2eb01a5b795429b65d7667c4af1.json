Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:  \n** updated Dwarf Fortress to 40_07\n - updated Phoebus graphics\n - updated Ironhand graphics\n - pulled Fricy's CLA update (https://github.com/fricy/DFgraphics)\n - pulled Fricy's Mayday update\n - pulled Fricy's Spacefox update\n - updated default settings\n** updated Dwarf Fortress to 40_08; fixes two common crash bugs\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to v23.6; for 40_08\n\nMD5:  2161FC7AF702658AC424B12A0FD28E17","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002c7cd44f24d2eb01a5b795429b65d7667c4af1","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_08+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002c7cd44f24d2eb01a5b795429b65d7667c4af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,44,124,212,79,36,210,235,1,165,183,149,66,155,101,215,102,124,74,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
