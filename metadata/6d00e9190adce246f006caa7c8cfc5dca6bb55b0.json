This creepy chiller is saved from the doldrums by Robert KraskerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s atmospheric cinematography, and fine performances from the ensemble cast. The BBC later filmed the story for television in 1987.\n\nIn 1845, 17-year-old Caroline (Jean Simmons) is nursing her dying father. He has enough faith in the reform of his reprobate brother, Silas (Derrick de Marney), suspected but in the clear of murder, to place her under his wing after his death. The hitherto naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve heroine soon learns that scheming Uncle Silas is planning to kill her in order to get his hands on the family fortune, aided by the equally corrupt governess Madame de la Rougierre.&quot; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5608/001wn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5608/001wn.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img121.imageshack.us/img121/5739/009.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img121.imageshack.us/img121/5739/009.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/5157/012se.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/5157/012se.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5451/019d.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5451/019d.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/81/023.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/81/023.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------not my rip----------\n\nFilesize.....: 1,351,004,160 bytes\nRuntime......: 1:42:39 (147660 frames)\nVideo Codec..: XviD ISO MPEG-4 (//)\nVideo Bitrate: 1649 kbps\nBits/Pixel: 0.224\nAspect Ratio.: 640x480 (1.333)\nFramerate....: 23.976 fps\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 93kbps 1ch VBR 48000Hz\nLanguage.....: English \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
