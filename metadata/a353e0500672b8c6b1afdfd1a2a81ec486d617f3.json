His musical education \nbegan when he started to play the battery of traditional percussion \ninstruments at the age of eight and soon moved to guitar. He was a \nplayer in the National Orchestra of Mali for many seasons. As time \nwent on he had a major part in a variety of musical groups that \nperformed everything from traditional percussion music to hybrids \nof European and American pop. His growing international fame is \npartially due to performances at a number of international music \nfestivals and his acclaimed solo debut, Amours Jarabi, in 1997. \nEven though the critical reports of his debut were overwhelmingly \npositive, his lack of distribution prevented international success. \nSoleil de Minuit was released in the United States by Tinder in 2001. \nThis record introduced his moody, spiritual Afro-pop to an \ninternational audience and was widely embraced by world music \naudiences. As a songwriter he incorporates elements of bright \nAfro-pop and Latin pop into songs with topics ranging from simple \nthemes of love and relationships to highly politicized statements of \nAfrican culture. ~ \nNate Cavalieri, All Music Guide\n\n\nfrogtoprince","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a353e0500672b8c6b1afdfd1a2a81ec486d617f3","amp;dn":"Mama+Sissoko-Amours+Jarabi+%28African+Guitar+Blues%29+Reseed+3+320+k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a353e0500672b8c6b1afdfd1a2a81ec486d617f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,83,224,80,6,114,184,198,177,175,223,209,162,168,30,196,134,214,23,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
