The album was released in South Africa and Switzerland on 19 October 2007, and released worldwide on 23 October 2007.\n\nThe cover artwork was designed by David Ho, the same artist who designed the Vicious Delicious cover for Infected Mushroom. The covers apparently display the same character: Candice the Ghost.\n\nThree singles, &quot;Fake It&quot;, &quot;Rise Above This&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; have been released from the album with all three being top 10 singles, the former two reaching the top position on several Billboard charts, despite generally negative reviews from critics (fuck them), scoring a 39 out of 100 on Metacritic. The album was reissued in 2009, featuring a fourth single, a cover of George Michael's &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, as the final single from the album. It is the first Seether album to reach gold status in their home country, South Africa.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n    2 Credits\n    3 Album information\n    \n   \nTrack listing\n\n\nStandard edition \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Like Suicide&quot;   \t4:14\n2. \t&quot;Fake It&quot;   \t3:13\n3. \t&quot;Breakdown&quot;   \t3:29\n4. \t&quot;FMLYHM&quot;   \t3:28\n5. \t&quot;Fallen&quot;   \t4:18\n6. \t&quot;Rise Above This&quot;   \t3:23\n7. \t&quot;No Jesus Christ&quot;   \t7:05\n8. \t&quot;Six Gun Quota&quot;   \t3:23\n9. \t&quot;Walk Away from the Sun&quot;   \t4:13\n10. \t&quot;Eyes of the Devil&quot;   \t5:00\n11. \t&quot;Don't Believe&quot;   \t4:34\n12. \t&quot;Waste&quot;   \t4:26\n\n\t60:13 \t\n[\n    &quot;Quirk&quot; is a demo version of &quot;Fake It&quot; &amp; was apparently recorded in Morgan's bedroom.\n\n   \n\nCredits\n\nSeether\n\n    Shaun Morgan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, guitar\n    Dale Stewart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    John Humphrey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Troy McLawhorn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (tracks 13 &amp; 14)\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Howard Benson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, programming\n    Space Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n\nTechnical credits\n\n    Howard Benson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ producer, audio production\n    Mike Plotnikoff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineer\n    Hatsukazu &quot;Hatch&quot; Inagaki Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineer\n    Paul DeCarli Ã¢â‚¬â€œ digital editing\n    Ted Jensen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering\n    Jon Nicholson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drum technician\n    Marc VanGool Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar techician\n    Scott D.

The band had this to say on their official webpage:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tHere we are, about to embark on the release of our favorite Seether record to date and can guarantee that you will all feel the same. Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces is a hearty serving of the usual Seether sting and grit with an added twist of lime. We have been working hard in the studio for months recording the album and there are only a few loose ends to cinch up before all is said and done. We can't wait to hit the road to share the new shit with everyone. In the meantime the remolded site should make it easier for you guys to share your undying love for us, keep up with everyone, and get all the news that will pass through here in coming weeks. The album is dedicated to Eugene &quot;Junior&quot; Welgemoed. Junior has always offered the band more support and love than we've ever given ourselves. He has lit an uncontainable fire under us, and without him we will never be the same again. Cheers to taking the world by storm...\n\nAnd It is still a great listen. I had been feeling like something was missing from all the music I keep around me and as you can Imagine I have a couple of albums around.\nAnyway I put this on and listened to the whole thing and I was made better from it. But seriously it sounded so good that i decided to post it I have posted some Seether in the past but I dont think I did this one and if I did, well Its time again cause im listening as I type this summary  &quot;Walk Away From the Sun&quot; is playing and im ready to sing, thank the power you cant hear me or it would probably make ya wanna do a track 1.\n\n\n Now, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage NOT wal-mart)that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1efd2303fd53481afab175a226613b87b8e0700a","amp;dn":"Seether+-+Finding+Beauty+In+Negative+Places++2007++a4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1efd2303fd53481afab175a226613b87b8e0700a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,253,35,3,253,83,72,26,250,177,117,162,38,97,59,135,184,224,112,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
