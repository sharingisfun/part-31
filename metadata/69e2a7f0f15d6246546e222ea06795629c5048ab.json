As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot in the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them. The Criterion Collection is proud to present Gillo Pontecorvo's tour de force a film with astonishing relevance today.\n\n# DISC 1: THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS\n# - New high-definition digital transfer, enhanced for widescreen televisions\n\n# DISC 2: PONTECORVO AND THE FILM\n# - Gillo Pontecorvo: The Dictatorship of Truth (1992): a 37-minute documentary, narrated by literary critic Edward Said\n# - Exclusive 51-minute documentary on the making of The Battle of Algiers, featuring new interviews with the director, cinematographer, composer, editor, actors, and film historians\n# - Five Directors (17 mins., 2004): Spike Lee, Mira Nair, Julian Schnabel, Steven Soderbergh, and Oliver Stone on the films influence, style, and importance\n\n# DISC 3: THE FILM AND HISTORY\n# - Remembering History (69 mins., 2004): an exclusive documentary that reconstructs the Algerian experience of the battle for independence, featuring interviews with historians and revolutionaries, including military leader Saadi Yacef\n# - &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™tats dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢rmes&quot; (2002): a 28-minute documentary excerpt featuring senior French military officers recalling the use of torture and execution to combat the rebellion\n# - The Battle of Algiers: A Case Study (25 mins., 2004): Richard A.
