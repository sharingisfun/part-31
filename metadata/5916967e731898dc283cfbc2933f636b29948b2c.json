Prompted in part by one of the recent pieces of repressive British legislation, the film also satirizes the neuroses of the photographer and English society.\n\nA male model strikes poses which illustrate a photographer&amp;#039;s voice-over monologue on the historical difficulty of picturing the male nude. The film deals with censorship and obsenity, artistry and pornography.\n\n24 Minutes, 169MB\nVIDEO: DivX 5 352x240 23.98fps\nAUDIO: MP3 44100Hz 192Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5916967e731898dc283cfbc2933f636b29948b2c","amp;dn":"What+Can+I+Do+With+A+Male+Nude-Gay+Themed+Short+1985+Ron+Peck.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5916967e731898dc283cfbc2933f636b29948b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,22,150,126,115,24,152,220,40,60,251,194,147,63,99,107,41,148,139,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
