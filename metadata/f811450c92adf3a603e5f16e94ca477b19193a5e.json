It played a key role in popularizing classical music performed on electronic synthesizers, which had until then been relegated to experimental and &quot;pop&quot; music. This fostered a significant increase in interest in electronically rendered music in general, and the Moog synthesizer in particular.\n\nSwitched-On Bach was one of the first classical albums to sell 500,000 copies. Entering Billboard's pop Top 40 charts on March 1, 1969, it climbed quickly to the Top 10; it stayed in the Top 40 for 17 weeks,[2] and in the Top 200 for more than a year. In the 1970 Grammy Awards, the album took three prizes: Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) and Best Engineered Classical Recording.\n\nCarlos first came to prominence in 1968 with Switched-On Bach, a recording of music by J.S. Bach painstakingly assembled, phrase-by-phrase, on the Moog synthesizer, at the time a relatively new and unknown instrument. The album earned three Grammy Awards in 1969. Other classical recordings followed. Carlos later began releasing original compositions, including the first-ever album of synthesized environmental sounds, Sonic Seasonings (1972) and an album exploring alternate tunings Beauty in the Beast (1986). She has also worked in film music, notably writing and performing scores for two Stanley Kubrick movies, A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining (1980), as well as Walt Disney's Tron.\nContents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f811450c92adf3a603e5f16e94ca477b19193a5e","amp;dn":"Switched-On+Bach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f811450c92adf3a603e5f16e94ca477b19193a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,17,69,12,146,173,243,166,3,229,241,110,148,202,71,123,25,25,58,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
