Drawing its participants from both the traditionalist wing of \ncountry and the long-in-the-tooth southern rockers, the disc straddles the \nline between rock and country much as junior always has. On the country \nside, there is a nice mix of big names like Montgomery Gentry, Tracy \nLawrence, and Alan Jackson, who turns in one of the disc's highlights with an \naching version of the ballad &quot;The Blues Man,&quot; and smaller stars who shine \nbrightly: Andy Griggs weeps his way convincingly through &quot;Old Habits&quot;; Trick \nPony, featuring the lone female to be found here, turns in a rollicking version \nof &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight&quot;; and Chad Brock pulls off \na coup by roping in John Anderson, George Jones, and Williams Jr. to help \nhim sing &quot;A Country Boy Can Survive.&quot; The rockers are represented by the \ncurrent incarnations of bands that ruled the 1970s airwaves. These songs \nare generally less successful than the ones the country artists perform. The \nMarshall Tucker Band sound old and broke on &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Have \nSettled Down,&quot; .38 Special tunelessly stomps its way over and through &quot;If It \nWill It Will,&quot; and Lynyrd Skynrd sounds pretty lame attempting a metal boogie \nversion of &quot;Born to Boogie&quot; (they probably need to stop hanging out with Kid \nRock). The only rock artist who sounds half decent is Dan Baird from the \nGeorgia Satellites. He turns in a nasty version of &quot;Whiskey Bent &amp; Hell Bound&quot; \nthat actually sounds better than the original. Speaking of the original, \nWilliams Jr. claims the last track of the disc for himself, performing a heartfelt \nversion of &quot;Outlaw's Reward&quot; featuring many of the artists who appear on his \ntribute and also Stevie Wonder (!) on harmonica. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b14e0d5d62c269ae3a9918dafc45d4ee162591d","amp;dn":"VA-The+Songs+of+Hank+Williams%2C+Jr.+%28A+Bocephus+Collection%29+%5B2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b14e0d5d62c269ae3a9918dafc45d4ee162591d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,20,224,213,214,44,38,154,227,169,145,141,175,196,93,78,225,98,89,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
