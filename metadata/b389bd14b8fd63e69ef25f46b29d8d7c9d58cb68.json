It was recorded in the mid-'70s when Chet Atkins was in his fifties and Les Paul was in his sixties. The latter had been in retirement for a decade before the recording of this album. Nashville studio musicians, including Randy Goodrum on piano and Larrie Londin on drums, back up the master guitarists, but this is by no means a country album. In fact, this album swings on classics such as &quot;Birth of the Blues,&quot; &quot;Avalon,&quot; and &quot;Caravan.&quot; Other classic songs, including &quot;It's Been a Long Time&quot; and &quot;It Had to Be You,&quot; are beautifully rendered, featuring Les Paul's instantly recognizable ringing bell tone and Chet Atkins' fluid, slightly twangy sound. The recording has an informal feel, with between-song banter (and even some joking in the middle of songs) included on the record, which adds to the enjoyment and warmth of this album. The listener knows that the musicians are having a great time. According to the liner notes, only two songs have any overdubs, so, &quot;You hear the music just as it came down.&quot; And it all &quot;came down&quot; beautifully. \n\n01 Chet Atkins and Les Paul It's Been a Long, Long Time.flac\t18.58 MB\n02 Chet Atkins and Les Paul MedleyÃ¯Â¼Å¡ MoonglowÃ¯Â¼ï¿½Picnic.flac\t23.59 MB\n03 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Caravan.flac\t18.75 MB\n04 Chet Atkins and Les Paul It Had To Be You.flac\t17.76 MB\n05 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Out of Nowhere.flac\t16.02 MB\n06 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Avalon.flac\t36.99 MB\n07 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Birth of the Blues.flac\t15.64 MB\n08 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Someday Sweetheart.flac\t17.08 MB\n09 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Deed I Do.flac\t13.73 MB\n10 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Lover Come Back to Me.flac\t16.16 MB\n11 Chet Atkins and Les Paul The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise.flac\t14.70 MB\n12 Chet Atkins and Les Paul You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me.flac\t15.53 MB\n13 Chet Atkins and Les Paul Caravan alternate version.flac\t18.17 MB\n14 Chet Atkins and Les Paul MoonglowÃ¯Â¼ï¿½Picnic rehearsal version.flac\t21.29 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b389bd14b8fd63e69ef25f46b29d8d7c9d58cb68","amp;dn":"Chet+Atkins+%26amp%3B+Les+Paul+-+Chester+%26amp%3B+Lester+%5B1975%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b389bd14b8fd63e69ef25f46b29d8d7c9d58cb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,137,189,20,184,253,99,230,158,242,95,70,178,157,141,124,157,88,203,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
