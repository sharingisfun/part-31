The work on the first album was started in October 1998. It was released in 2000 by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonopol RecordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which is part of Meisel Publishing Group. This album was very successful in Germany.

Soon after this, the album was re-released in more than 50 countries all around the world. For example, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIntentCityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (USA) released 12-track re-arranged version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMystic. Spirit.

The recording started in September 2000. The pre-edition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChapter 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released in March of 2001. A month later, this album was released officially with all the tracks re-arranged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454d10df80bbbb558a12f09734660bdb1ca21a7c","amp;dn":"Lesiem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454d10df80bbbb558a12f09734660bdb1ca21a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,77,16,223,128,187,187,85,138,18,240,151,52,102,11,219,28,162,26,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
