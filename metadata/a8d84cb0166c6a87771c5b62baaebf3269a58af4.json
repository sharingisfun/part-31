Cat Scratch Fever matched the focused ferocity of\n              Nugent's excellent 1975 debut (due to singer Derek St.\n              Holmes' re-entry into the band), featuring another\n              first-rate set of brash hard rockers. While the title\n              track is a certified classic anthem (the only solo-Nugent\n              single to crack the Top 30), other tracks are just as\n              delightful, such as the oh so subtle &quot;Wang Dang Sweet\n              Poontang.&quot; Further standouts include such underrated\n              compositions as &quot;Live It Up,&quot; &quot;Workin' Hard, Playin'\n              Hard,&quot; and &quot;Out of Control,&quot; plus the exquisitely melodic\n              instrumental &quot;Home Bound,&quot; which the Beastie Boys would\n              sample on their 1992 mega-hit album Check Your Head (the\n              track &quot;The Biz vs. the Nuge&quot;). A Top 20 release, Cat\n              Scratch Fever was the last Nugent release to feature his\n              original solo band, (St. Holmes, along with bassist Rob\n              Grange, left for good in 1978). And while he enjoyed\n              further chart success with such titles as Weekend\n              Warriors and Double Live Gonzo, many consider Cat Scratch\n              Fever to be Ted Nugent's finest hour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d84cb0166c6a87771c5b62baaebf3269a58af4","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Cat+Scratch+Fever+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d84cb0166c6a87771c5b62baaebf3269a58af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,216,76,176,22,108,106,135,119,28,91,98,186,174,191,50,105,165,138,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
