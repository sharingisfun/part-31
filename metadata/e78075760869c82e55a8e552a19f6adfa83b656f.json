(AAP, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-6008-6\r\n\r\nNanotechnology has the power to radically change the way cancer is diagnosed, imaged, and treated. The holistic approach to cancer involves noninvasive procedures that emphasize restoring the health of human energy fields. Presenting a wealth of information and research about the most potent cancer healing therapies, this forward-thinking book explores how nanomedicine, holistic medicine, and other cancer therapies play important roles in treatment of this disease. Topics include nanobiotechnology for antibacterial therapy and diagnosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer, antioxidants and combinatorial therapies, and optical and mechanical investigations of nanostructures for biomolecular detection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e78075760869c82e55a8e552a19f6adfa83b656f","amp;dn":"Nanomedicine+and+Cancer+Therapies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e78075760869c82e55a8e552a19f6adfa83b656f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,128,117,118,8,105,200,46,85,168,229,82,161,159,106,223,168,59,101,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
