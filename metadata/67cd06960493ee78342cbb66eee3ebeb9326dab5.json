Still, there are plenty of ways for a young vampire to die in the glittering city, a lesson that prince turned pauper Mircea Basarab must learn quickly. But there are opportunities, too - in the service of a secretive courtesan, in the bed of a beautiful senator, and in the hunt for an ancient assassin. As a vendetta older than Venice itself comes to a climax, Mircea struggles to evade the dangers of his current life, to come to terms with his past, and to uncover the truth hidden behind a city of masks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67cd06960493ee78342cbb66eee3ebeb9326dab5","amp;dn":"Karen+Chance+-+Cassandra+Palmer+4.3+-+Mask+-+Mircea+Basarab+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67cd06960493ee78342cbb66eee3ebeb9326dab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,205,6,150,4,147,238,120,52,44,187,102,238,227,235,235,147,38,218,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
