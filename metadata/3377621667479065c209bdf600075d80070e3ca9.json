Many users of QNX are currently looking at Embedded Linux as an alternative embedded OS, but are unsure of how to migrate. The Linux Foundation offers resources, training and an open source build tool, the Yocto Project, to help companies make this transition. IT executives, managers, and engineers have a fiduciary duty to investigate and recommend technology alternatives for technical, legal, strategic, or financial reasons. This article discusses what these persons interested in porting QNX-based embedded systems to an Embedded Linux platform should consider.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3377621667479065c209bdf600075d80070e3ca9","amp;dn":"Migrating+from+QNX+to+Embedded+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3377621667479065c209bdf600075d80070e3ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,119,98,22,103,71,144,101,194,9,189,246,0,7,93,128,7,14,60,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
