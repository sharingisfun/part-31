In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Denial-Death-Ernest-Becker/dp/0684832402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Denial-Death-Ernest-Becker/dp/0684832402&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3edca0367ba1140745e3885909d0df5e2c645ba","amp;dn":"The+Denial+of+Death+Ernest++epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3edca0367ba1140745e3885909d0df5e2c645ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,237,202,3,103,186,17,64,116,94,56,133,144,157,13,245,226,198,69,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
