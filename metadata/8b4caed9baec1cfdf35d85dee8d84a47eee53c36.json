Basic research on pain now emphasizes multidisciplinary approaches, including behavioral testing, electrophysiology and the application of many of the techniques of modern cell and molecular biology, including the use of transgenic animals.The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEncyclopedia of PainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is meant to provide a source of information that spans contemporary basic and clinical research on pain and pain therapy. It should be useful not only to researchers in these fields but also to practicing physicians and other health care professionals and to health caree ducators and administrators.The workis subdivided into 35 Fields, and the Field Editor of each of these describes the areas covered in the Fields in a brief reviewchapter. The topics included in a Field are the subject of a series of short essays, accompanied by key words, definitions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b4caed9baec1cfdf35d85dee8d84a47eee53c36","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Pain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b4caed9baec1cfdf35d85dee8d84a47eee53c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,76,174,217,186,236,28,253,243,93,133,222,232,216,74,71,238,229,60,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
