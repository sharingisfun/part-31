Until 2007, he was a senior lecturer in the Department of Political Science at the University of Haifa.\n\nPappe, a Jewish Israeli, born to a German Jewish family in Haifa in 1954, has been described by the Palestinian Salman Abu-Sitta (a prominent writer on the Palestinian right of return) as &quot;an honourable academic with integrity and conscience&quot;[1]. He is one of the Israeli &quot;new historians&quot;, a group of historians who are so-called because their writings, based on access to material recently released by the British and Israeli archives, has started to undermine myths about the foundation and early years of the Israeli state, myths that were promoted by an earlier generation of Israeli historians who were more concerned about building up the self-image of the new state than in historical accuracy.\n\nIn November 1999, Baudouin Loos (a journalist for the Brussels paper &quot;Le Soir&quot;) conducted a very interesting interview with PappÃƒÂ©. In an article which he wrote in Al-Ahram in May 2002, PappÃƒÂ© gives an interesting account of his experience as a Jewish child growing up in Haifa in the 1950s and how he finally became aware of the fact that he was living in a city whose Palestinian inhabitants had been expelled in 1948.\n\nIn early 2002, when Pappe was still at the University of Haifa, he was threatened with dismissal by the university because of his support for Teddy Katz, a Jewish graduate student at the university whose dissertation had brought to public attention the massacre, by Israeli forces in 1948, of a large portion of the population of the Arab village of Al-Tantura, on the coast south of Haifa. (See an article about the treatment meted out to Katz for daring to write about the subject. See a letter written by Ilan Pappe about his threatened dismissal.) After an international protest, the university withdrew the threatened dismissal proceedings. This threat to academic freedom was not covered in most Western media; however, there was an article in the English weekly edition of Al-Ahram about it. You can also read the on-line petition in support of Dr. PappÃƒÂ©, which was signed by several thousand intellectuals from many countries around the world, including many from within Israel. One of the most prominent supporters of Dr. Pappe during these attacks was another Jewish Israeli, another of the new historians -- Avi Shlaim, Professor of International Relations and a fellow of St Antony's College at the University of Oxford. On 16 May 2002, Prof. Shlaim wrote to Aharon Ben-Ze'ev, the Rector of the university in Haifa, stating that the charges against Dr. PappÃƒÂ© were &quot;a blatant violation of Dr Pappe's right to academic freedom and it is your duty, as Rector of Haifa University, to uphold his right&quot;.\n\nWhile the Katz controversy brought the Al-Tantura massacre to public attention in Israel, it had been well-known among Palestinians -- see a collection of eye-witness accounts from survivors of the massacre. (It is interesting to note that the Tantura massacre was carried out by the 33rd Battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade and that, during the 1948 War of Independence, Ariel Sharon commanded an infantry company in the Alexandroni Brigade. One cannot help wondering whether there is any causal psychological connection between the Al-Tantura massacre and later massacres in which Sharon was involved: the massacre of 66 villagers at Kibya (Qibya) in October 1953, committed by Commando Unit 101 of the IDF which was led by Sharon; the massacre at Qalqilyah in 1955; the murder of 273 unarmed prisoners, Egyptian soldiers and Sudanese workers, during the 1956 Suez invasion; the more famous massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside Beirut in September 1982.)\n\nDr. PappÃƒÂ© is a member of the Advisory Board of the Council for Palestinian Restitution and Repatriation (CPRR), an organization which declares that &quot;every Palestinian has a legitimate, individual right to return to his or her original home and to absolute restitution of his or her property.&quot; \n\n---------\n\nSince the Holocaust, it has been almost impossible to hide large-scale crimes against humanity. In our communicative world, few modern catastrophes are concealed from the public eye. And yet, Ilan Pappe unveils, one such crime has been erased from the global public memory: the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in 1948. But why is it denied, and by whom? The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine offers an investigation of this mystery.\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. In his latest work, renowned Israeli author and academic Pappe (A History of Modern Palestine) does not mince words, doing Jimmy Carter one better (or worse, depending on one's point of view) by accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity beginning in the 1948 war for independence, and continuing through the present. Focusing primarily on Plan D (Dalet, in Hebrew), conceived on March 10, 1948, Pappe demonstrates how ethnic cleansing was not a circumstance of war, but rather a deliberate goal of combat for early Israeli military units led by David Ben-Gurion, whom Pappe labels the &quot;architect of ethnic cleansing.&quot; The forced expulsion of 800,000 Palestinians between 1948-49, Pappe argues, was part of a long-standing Zionist plan to manufacture an ethnically pure Jewish state. Framing his argument with accepted international and UN definitions of ethnic cleansing, Pappe follows with an excruciatingly detailed account of Israeli military involvement in the demolition and depopulation of hundreds of villages, and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Arab inhabitants. An accessible, learned resource, this volume provides important inroads into the historical antecedents of today's conflict, but its conclusions will not be easy for everyone to stomach: Pappe argues that the ethnic cleansing of Palestine continues today, and calls for the unconditional return of all Palestinian refugees and an end to the Israeli occupation. Without question, Pappe's account will provoke ire from many readers; importantly, it will spark discussion as well.\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
