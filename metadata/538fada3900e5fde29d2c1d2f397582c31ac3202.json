Eating Disorders. Bizarre hazing rituals. All horrible, slanderous stereotypes associated with sorority sisters. And all sadly true. Modern sorority life deserves a serious, sensitive and mature depiction. Thankfully, that's not what HAZED is about. HAZED is a dark comedy about three young girls' perilous journey through the world of sororities and eating disorders. From the creator of the critically acclaimed GROUNDED, HAZED is to comics what &quot;Heathers&quot; and &quot;Mean Girls&quot; are to film, only smarter, meaner and funnier.\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners!\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538fada3900e5fde29d2c1d2f397582c31ac3202","amp;dn":"Hazed+%282008%29+%28GN%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538fada3900e5fde29d2c1d2f397582c31ac3202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,143,173,163,144,14,95,222,41,210,193,210,243,151,88,44,49,172,50,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
