But at home, Ted is the one chopping the vegetables and working the stove, trying unusual ingredients and new techniques, from roasting earthy sunchokes in a piping-hot oven to develop their sweetness or transforming leftover pinot noir into complexly flavored homemade vinegar. In fact, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discoveries like these that propel him into the kitchen nightlyÃ¢â‚¬â€that, of course, and eating the delicious results with friends! Now Ted invites likeminded cooks to roll up their sleeves, crank up the stereo, and join him in the kitchen for some fun.\nWhile there are mountains of cookbooks featuring five-minute, three-ingredient, weeknight recipes for harried households, here is a book for food lovers who want to lose themselves in the delight of perfectly slow-roasting a leg of lambÃ¢â‚¬â€Mexican styleÃ¢â‚¬â€or whipping up a showstopping triple-layer cake. Ted is just such a cook and in his latest cookbook he shakes up expectations by topping bruschetta with tomatoes and strawberries; turning plums, sugar, and a bay leaf into an irresistible quick jam; putting everything you can think of on the grillÃ¢â‚¬â€from ribs and pork shoulder to chiles and green beans; and modernizing the traditional holiday trio of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce with fresh ingredients and a little booze. And where thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a will to make something from scratch, Ted provides a way, with recipes for homemade pickles, pizza, pasta, pork buns, preserved lemons, breads, quick jam, marshmallows, and more.\nWith more than 100 amazing recipes and gorgeous color photographs throughout, In My Kitchen is perfect for passionate home cooks looking for inspiring new recipes and techniques to add to their playbooks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332924a120c6730f8c186af9a95c2c9dd2b99d9d","amp;dn":"In+My+Kitchen+-100+Recipes+and+Discoveries+for+Passionate+Cooks+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332924a120c6730f8c186af9a95c2c9dd2b99d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,41,36,161,32,198,115,15,140,24,106,249,169,92,44,157,210,185,157,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
