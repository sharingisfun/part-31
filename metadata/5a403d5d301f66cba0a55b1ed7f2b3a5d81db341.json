While the Doctor tries to determine where the object may have landed, Rose goes off in search of a child she can hear calling for help. When she gets herself into a precarious situation, she's rescued by the rather handsome RAF Captain Jack Harkness, who owns a time machine of his own. The Doctor meanwhile meets Nancy who has an interesting way of arranging meals for homeless children. They are also being chased by the child Rose heard calling. The Doctor determines that human DNA is being rewritten but it's not obvious why or by who. \n\nAll Torrents are seeded for 24 hours at 150mb/s rate.\n\nBrought to you by Movie-Kingdom &amp; Friends!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a403d5d301f66cba0a55b1ed7f2b3a5d81db341","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+S01E09+-+Movie-Kingdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a403d5d301f66cba0a55b1ed7f2b3a5d81db341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,64,61,93,48,31,102,203,160,165,91,30,215,242,179,165,216,29,179,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
