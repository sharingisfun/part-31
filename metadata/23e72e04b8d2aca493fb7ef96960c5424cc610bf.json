The Neighbourhood\n\n\nLucy WiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song writing is steeped in the Appalachian and Celtic folk music traditions that surrounded her as she grew up in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Wise Family BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The album is a collection of timeless, universally recognisable stories woven around everyday characters and places. Lucy has brought together Chris Stone (violin), Holly Downes (double bass) and Graham McLeod (guitar) of New Acoustic group ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The String ContingentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with Melbourne accordionist and sound engineer Mischa Herman as her supporting band.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA wonderfully natural singer and uncommonly gifted writer, Lucy leads an excellent band. Prediction: within this decade she will be a noted songster, worldwide.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Doug Spencer, ABC Radio National\n\ncd ripped with dBpoweramp using ultra secure mode.\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/18/lucy-wise-and-the-bgollies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/09/18/lucy-wise-and-the-bgollies/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e72e04b8d2aca493fb7ef96960c5424cc610bf","amp;dn":"Lucy+Wise+and+the+B%5C%27Gollies...Lucy+Wise+and+the+B%5C%27Gollies%282011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e72e04b8d2aca493fb7ef96960c5424cc610bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,231,46,4,184,210,172,164,147,251,126,249,105,96,197,66,76,198,16,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
