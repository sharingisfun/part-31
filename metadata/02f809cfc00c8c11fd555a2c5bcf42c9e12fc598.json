ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of his Ã¢â‚¬Å“thing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Accordingly, I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t try to drop any new knowledge bombs. What Kind of World is an airtight, wonderfully crafted album that sounds like the freshest studio project of 1978. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a satisfying listen that you have to wonder if Jack White has it in for olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Brendan.\n\nBenson and White, bandmates in the Raconteurs, both released their new albums on April 23. To no oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprise, WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blunderbuss, which also wears its old-school influence proudly, has dominated both the charts and the chatter of music fans. In an otherwise lackluster week for new releases, the wonderful What Kind of World would have been the weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exciting album, hands down.\n\nFans of Styx and REO Speedwagon need look no further than BensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oeuvre, which holds the energetic, propulsive kind of pop-rock that made those bands household names. What Kind of World doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t indulge in the more bombastic, arena tendencies of those bands, instead keeping affairs on the mellow-and-confident side.\n\nRecorded entirely in analog and divided into two sides, any track on What Kind of World could serve as a single. The title track alternates between a slow burn and a sweeping chorus, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happy Most of the TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ settles into a nice, piano-heavy Ben Folds groove; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Light of DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ could easily be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sha ShaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-era Ben Kweller tune. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here In the DeadlightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bears more than a passing resemblance to RushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tom SawyerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the chorus.\n\nBenson has a poetic flair, singing on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happy Most of the TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“heavenly sway of teenage hips,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pretty BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ crooning Ã¢â‚¬Å“keep me anywhere you want, just never set me free.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That track is a darker one, sounding more than a bit like White himself and setting off the more somber tone with a beautiful violin part. The bluesy overtones match perfectly with lines like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why now, baby, would a lady bring the heat?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhat Kind of World excels in its accessibility. Benson writes songs that sound like what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to expect good old fashioned rock music to sound like. Even in moments of stylistic experimentation, like the folk-flavored Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the Fence,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Benson keeps things tight and toe-tappingly listenable Ã¢â‚¬â€ there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any navel-gazing diversions or tedious Ã¢â‚¬Å“artisticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ indulgences. What Kind of World is just well-built music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f809cfc00c8c11fd555a2c5bcf42c9e12fc598","amp;dn":"Brendan+Benson+-+What+Kind+of+World+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f809cfc00c8c11fd555a2c5bcf42c9e12fc598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,248,9,207,192,12,140,17,253,85,90,44,91,207,66,201,225,47,197,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
