As will soon become quite \nobvious, Tom also read his book for an audio release.  I can&amp;#039;t find anything\nabout the audio release, but in my years of collecting every type of media \nrelated to Doctor Who, I obviously found this audiobook online somewhere.  It \nis sampled at a terribly low rate of 32k, but it&amp;#039;s listenable and is the only\nversion I have ever seen.   Can ANYONE, please, who has this audio share it at \na better sample rate like at 320k, cause after all we are not living in the age \nof modems and 20 MEG hard drives anymore...   :)  \n\n2) Apparently a company called Reeltime Pictures did a very in depth interview\nwith Tom in 1991 and created a VHS tape which has the exact same name;\n&quot;Who on Earth is Tom Baker?&quot;    It is included as 5 MP4 video files.  If you \ncan&amp;#039;t see them on your computer just download Apple ITunes, VLC Player or my \nfavorite GOMPlayer.   All free of course.  Just google those.   And with this \nvideo, once again if someone has a higher quality version please do share it. \nHell, just upload the whole DVD if you have it and thanks in advance.  \n\nEnjoy life, and enjoy Doctor Who. \n\nThe Friendly Neighborhood Execution Beast\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403a91b4119ee4a0de34b36f8e20d9c297a73c15","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Who+on+Earth+is+Tom+Baker+-+Audio+%2B+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403a91b4119ee4a0de34b36f8e20d9c297a73c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,58,145,180,17,158,228,160,222,52,179,111,142,32,217,194,151,167,60,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
