Ruby Turner's vocals were originally performed by KT Tunstall, although she later backed out of this role, but is still featured on the album playing flute, guitar and singing backing vocals.\n\nSeasick Steve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A sixty-seventy-something year old (ex)-Hobo from Mississippi who over the last 5 years or so has gone from zero to hero. I guess it must have a lot to do with how authentic he is, as far removed from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“popÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scene as possible, apparently he still lives in a banged out old camper that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had forever. The only difference is that now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of Jack Daniels Whiskey cosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they wanted to sponsor him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090c01f438c5d5876fad5891ed04e2f87aaa92a8","amp;dn":"Seasick+Steve+-+I+Started+Out+With+Nothin+And+I+Still+Got+Most+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090c01f438c5d5876fad5891ed04e2f87aaa92a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,12,1,244,56,197,213,135,111,173,88,145,237,4,226,248,122,170,146,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
