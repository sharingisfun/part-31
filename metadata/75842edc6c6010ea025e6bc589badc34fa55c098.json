Muidinga is a fragile boy, whose bigger wish is to find his family. He reads in a diary, found beside a dead body, the history of a woman that seeks her son in a ship. Due to his hope to find his own family, Muidinga convinces himself that he is the boy who is being search. He tries to find the woman, with the help of Tuahir, a thin old man full of experience and wisdom. However, Tuahir doesnt know that sometimes the histories of the diary are created by Muidinga. The journey is hard: they move between refugees in state of delirium. Not to get insane, they only have each other. The road which way they walk, as sleepwalkers, is magic: understand their desires and move them from a place to another and doesnt let them die until they achieve the so dreamt sea. Based on Mia Coutou's acclaimed Portuguese novel of the same name, Teresa Prata's transporting drama underscores the power of imagination in surviving, and ultimately overcoming, the catastrophe of war.\n\nFile Format : AVI (Audio Video Interleave)\nVideo Format: MPEG-4 Visual\nVideo Bitrate: 891 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\nResolution: 672 x 368\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.144\n\nAudio Format: MPEG Audio\nAudio Bitrate: 112 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75842edc6c6010ea025e6bc589badc34fa55c098","amp;dn":"+Terra+Son%26acirc%3Bmbula%2FSleepwalking+Land+%282007%29+DVDRip-XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75842edc6c6010ea025e6bc589badc34fa55c098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,132,46,220,108,96,16,234,2,94,107,197,137,186,220,52,250,85,192,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
