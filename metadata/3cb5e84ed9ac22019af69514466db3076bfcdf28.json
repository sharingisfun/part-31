Peter Lorre is Dr. Karl Neumeister a world-weary, strangely acting, chain-smoking, hard-drinking and hard-working physician in the camp. The loner doctor is confronted with his sordid past when a refugee by the name of Nowak (Karl John) shows up posing as a chemist and is assigned by the barrack&amp;#039;s head to assist the doctor in giving inoculations. The film goes into flashback when the doctor and his mysterious new assistant go into the canteen to get stinking drunk and talk about their coincidental meeting.\n\n\n\n\nScreens are from a different rip of slightly inferior quality.\n\n~~~~~~ Der Verlorene.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,285,625,856                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:33:26                \nFrame Count:....................................140126             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................496                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.355                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1633                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.196&quot;  \n\nGreyscale encoding.                  \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\nAC3 audio because I was lazy and the audio file size was only slightly larger than the MP3 in this case.\n\n------my rip----\n\nI cleaned up the English subs somewhat but they could use more work if anyone is up to the job.
