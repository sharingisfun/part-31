She had a history of personal misfortune, overcoming ill health (she suffered from crippling arthritis; by the time she became Queen she was a virtual invalid) and living through seventeen miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births in seventeen years. By the end of her comparatively short twelve-year reign, Britain had emerged as a great power; the succession of outstanding victories won by her general, John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, had humbled France and laid the foundations for BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future naval and colonial supremacy.\n\nWhile the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military was performing dazzling exploits on the continent, her own attentionÃ¢â‚¬â€indeed her realmÃ¢â‚¬â€rested on a more intimate conflict: the female friendship on which her happiness had for decades depended and which became for her a source of utter torment.\n\nAt the core of Anne SomersetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riveting new biography, published to great acclaim in England (Ã¢â‚¬Å“DefinitiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€London Evening Standard; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wonderfully pacy and absorbingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Daily Mail), is a portrait of this deeply emotional, complex bond between two very different women: Queen AnneÃ¢â‚¬â€reserved, stolid, shrewd; and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, wife of the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great generalÃ¢â‚¬â€beautiful, willful, outspoken, whose acerbic wit was equally matched by her fearsome temper.\n\nAgainst a fraught backgroundÃ¢â‚¬â€the revolution that deposed AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, James II, and brought her to power . . . religious differences (she was born ProtestantÃ¢â‚¬â€her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conversion to Catholicism had grave implicationsÃ¢â‚¬â€and she grew up so suspicious of the Roman church that she considered its doctrines Ã¢â‚¬Å“wicked and dangerousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) . . . violently partisan politics (Whigs versus Tories) . . . a war with France that lasted for almost her entire reign . . . the constant threat of foreign invasion and civil warÃ¢â‚¬â€the much-admired historian, author of Elizabeth I (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ExhilaratingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Spectator; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ample, stylish, eloquentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post Book World), tells the extraordinary story of how Sarah goaded and provoked the Queen beyond endurance, and, after the withdrawal of AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favor, how her replacement, SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin, the feline Abigail Masham, became the ubiquitous royal confidante and, so Sarah whispered to growing scandal, the object of the Queen's sexual infatuation.\n\nTo write this remarkably rich and passionate biography, Somerset, winner of the Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography, has made use of royal archives, parliamentary records, personal correspondence and previously unpublished material.\n\nQueen Anne is history on a large scaleÃ¢â‚¬â€a revelation of a centuries-overlooked monarch.
