I think that  I ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¶Ã‚Â¼ÃŽâ€œÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ±m not  the only one who came upon his work in this way.\nDaniel Johnston is a Texas man who was born in the 60's and always dreamed of becoming famous with his music, something that ultimately achievement.\nIt is difficult starting  to talk about him  without falling into the systematic repetition of his manic-depressive condition,  his frustration or his emptiness sentimental for an unattainable love.
