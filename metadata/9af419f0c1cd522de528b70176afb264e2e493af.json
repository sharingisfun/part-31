Then Moto Racer 2 came, took everything that was great about its predecessor and made it even better! The fun-factor is still there, stronger than ever, supplemented by all sorts of new stuff. You've got a wide range of tracks - a whopping 32 in total - you've got great third-person animations and a great first-person camera that lets you feel just how fast you're going. Last, but not least, the game comes with a track editor, giving it virtually infinite replayability. All this makes Moto Racer 2 one of the best arcade racers for the PC.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\nPolice Quest 1-2-3-4\nPrince of Persia 2008\nLionheart: Legacy of the Crusade\nBeyond Divinity\nStonekeep\nDeus Ex 2: Invisible War\nDriftmoon\nSilver\nRunaway series\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\nEdna &amp; Harvey: TB + HE\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af419f0c1cd522de528b70176afb264e2e493af","amp;dn":"Moto+Racer+2+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af419f0c1cd522de528b70176afb264e2e493af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,244,25,240,193,205,82,45,229,40,183,1,118,175,178,100,226,228,147,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
