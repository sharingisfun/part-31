It's a frustrating world, but an optimistic and warm one.\n\nGervais told The Radio Times: &quot;It's about his life: the life of a showbiz dwarf. He plays himself, we play ourselves, it's sort of like Curb Your Enthusiasm.&quot;\n\nHe later added at the Banff World Television Festival: &quot;It's the funniest thing we've ever done.&quot; He said this comedy would be &quot;pure funny&quot; without the pathos of The Office or the drama of Extras. &quot;Warwick, in real life, is an actor and runs a company so we are taking that and skewing it. We are giving him small man complex, making him jealous, manipulative and self-obessed. He'll run a company called Dwarves for Hire but steals all the jobs.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab94c629f3acd505a28aa6f286be67c828131d5","amp;dn":"Lifes.Too.Short.S01E08.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab94c629f3acd505a28aa6f286be67c828131d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,185,76,98,159,58,205,80,90,40,170,111,40,107,230,124,130,129,49,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
