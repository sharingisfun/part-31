This third installation of the CD-only \\&quot;Annex\\&quot; compilation series samples 2000 and 2001?s standout EP and album VINYL-ONLY tracks found among Tresor numbers 139 through 179. Appearing for the first time ever on CD format is Matthew Herbert\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Housey Housey Mix\\&quot; of \\&quot;Mistakes\\&quot; that he recorded exclusively for Tresor. Tobias Schmidt\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Hard &amp; Heavy\\&quot; is taken from his EP ?Real Life? (Tresor.179) and the unreleased Drexciya track \\&quot;Digital Tsunami\\&quot; introduces the second Drexciya album on Tresor \\&quot;Harnessed the Storm\\&quot; (Tresor.181). You\\&amp;#039;ll also find Ben Sims and Subhead from their twelve-inch debuts on Tresor and the Shufflemaster Remix of Sender Berlin\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Zeitsignal\\&quot; - and this is not the only club hit you?ll find here. \\&quot;Annex 4\\&quot; is a collection for the home-listeners of high-quality electronic music and for all DJs who\\&amp;#039;d like to have an inside hint about which Tresor tracks should definitely be part of their set.\n\nOriginally released 2001-11-15\n\nTracks:\n\nKlub DÃ‚Â´Out\nHoly Ghost - (Tresor Records)\n\t\nCleopatraÃ‚Â´s Needle\nStewart Walker - (Tresor Records) \n\nDigital Tsunami\nDrexciya - (Tresor Records)\n\nHell Toupe\nDave Tarrida - (Tresor Records)\n\t\nPussy Puppy\nNeil Landstrumm - (Tresor Records)\n\nHot &amp; Heavy\nTobias Schmidt - (Tresor Records)\n\nToxic\nSubhead - (Tresor Records) \n\nPsiho-Deliya\nDiskordia - (Tresor Records) \n\nOuttake\nBen Sims - (Tresor Records)\n\nSketch Ups\nThe Advent - (Tresor Records)\n\nFourthinter (Narita Remix)\nDJ Shufflemaster - (Tresor Records)\n\nZeitsignal (Shufflemaster Mix)\nSender Berlin - (Tresor Records)\n\nDrive #6 (Edit 2)\nFumiya Tanaka - (Tresor Records)\n\nMistakes (Housey Housey Version)\nMatthew Herbert - (Tresor Records)\n\n&lt;a href=\\&quot;http://www.tresorberlin.com/label/data.pl?release=Tresor.180CD\\&quot;&gt;http://www.tresorberlin.com/label/data.pl?release=Tresor.180CD&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0010059f34a5db85677e933bcd5621d05f6e65f","amp;dn":"Tresor.180CD+-+Various+Artists+-+Annex+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0010059f34a5db85677e933bcd5621d05f6e65f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,1,0,89,243,74,93,184,86,119,233,51,188,213,98,29,5,246,230,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
