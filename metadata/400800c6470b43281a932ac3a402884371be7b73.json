I had the good fortune to hear Elis Regina and her genius partner in music and life, Cesar Camargo Mariano in concert. Now we have the fruit of this collaboration, their daughter Maria Rita, born in 1977. She has channeled her mother&amp;#039;s voice, and I mean that as a compliment. I love her selection of material and the accompaniment. When I first heard this CD, I was sure her father played on it. Not so. I also am pleased that she is recording Milton Nascimento&amp;#039;s material. Elis was one of the first to cover his tunes in the 1960&amp;#039;s. In Brazil, they would call her a &quot;porta bandeira,&quot; the one carrying on the legacy of her many predecessors.\n\n2. When I heard Elis daughter was about to release a cd I was thinking &quot;what&amp;#039;s the big deal? It&amp;#039;s just another female singer anyways&quot;. Oh my,oh my was I ever wrong! Maria Rita is adorable, so down to earth and she gives me the feeling she&amp;#039;s singing directly to each one of us like a very good friend that lives just next door. Very intimate. Maria Rita is the big deal right now: her voice is great, the music selection is great and hope she releases another one soon. Gotta love this MPB style.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400800c6470b43281a932ac3a402884371be7b73","amp;dn":"Maria+Rita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400800c6470b43281a932ac3a402884371be7b73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,8,0,198,71,11,67,40,26,147,42,195,164,2,136,67,113,190,123,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
