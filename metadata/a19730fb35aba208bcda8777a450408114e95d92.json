Starting with Alexander Graham BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary Ã¢â‚¬Å“harmonic telegraph,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by the middle of the twentieth century the phone system had grown into something extraordinary, a web of cutting-edge switching machines and human operators that linked together millions of people like never before. But the network had a billion-dollar flaw, and once people discovered it, things would never be the same.\n\nExploding the Phone tells this story in full for the first time. It traces the birth of long-distance communication and the telephone, the rise of AT&amp;TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monopoly, the creation of the sophisticated machines that made it all work, and the discovery of Ma BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AchillesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heel. Phil Lapsley expertly weaves together the clandestine underground of Ã¢â‚¬Å“phone phreaksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who turned the network into their electronic playground, the mobsters who exploited its flaws to avoid the feds, the explosion of telephone hacking in the counterculture, and the war between the phreaks, the phone company, and the FBI.\n\nThe product of extensive original research, Exploding the Phone is a ground-breaking, captivating book.&quot;\n\nReviews:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Phil Lapsley's Exploding the Phone is an authoritative, jaunty and enjoyable account of their sometimes comical, sometimes impressive and sometimes disquieting misdeeds. . . . The author's love of his subject pervades Exploding the Phone and persuaded this reader, at least, that the phone phreaks are worthy of thoughtful attention.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Wall Street Journal\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fantastically fun romp through the world of early phone hackers, who sought free long distance, and in the end helped launch the computer era.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Seattle Times \n\nThis torrent contains the original retail EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
