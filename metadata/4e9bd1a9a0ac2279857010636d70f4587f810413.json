He went much further though and was sucked down a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy and into the middle of a battle. He was rescued by a group of escaping prisoners and taken aboard their ship, a living ship. As the years went by, Crichton has made enemies, powerful and dangerous enemies. On his journey to find a way back home, he freed other captives who became part of the crew on Moya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e9bd1a9a0ac2279857010636d70f4587f810413","amp;dn":"Farscape+%5BComplete%5D+%28iPhone%2FiPod+Touch%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e9bd1a9a0ac2279857010636d70f4587f810413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,155,209,169,160,172,34,121,133,112,16,99,109,112,244,88,127,129,4,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
