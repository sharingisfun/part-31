Here MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and guitar work are sure and emotionally effective, and her personality retains a bubbliness and youthful sincerity that contrasts with the sometimes dour tone of her songs. For fans curious about Joni MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early days as a musician, Live at the Second Fret 1966 reveals the talent was clearly there long before she was embraced by the mass audience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1c6f5e9b00b5036aaf4443272021953c114594","amp;dn":"Joni+Mitchell+-+Live+at+the+Second+Fret+1966+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1c6f5e9b00b5036aaf4443272021953c114594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,28,111,94,155,0,181,3,106,175,68,67,39,32,33,149,60,17,69,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
