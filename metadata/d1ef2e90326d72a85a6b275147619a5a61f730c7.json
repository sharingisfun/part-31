Scans of the front and back covers are also included.\n\nThis is the classic lineup, including Gary Richrath.  REO was a fun band to see live - always entertaining and often cheap (compared to others).  I think I never spent more than $10 going to an REO show.  Well worth it.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ef2e90326d72a85a6b275147619a5a61f730c7","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+Live+in+Denver+1980+-+VHS+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ef2e90326d72a85a6b275147619a5a61f730c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,239,46,144,50,109,114,168,90,107,39,81,71,97,154,90,97,247,48,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
