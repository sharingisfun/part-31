These ensembles were all recorded individually in a large film scoring studio. Because theyÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³re made up of different players (avoiding the dreaded ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´same playerÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ sound), they combine seamlessly to produce entirely cohesive small, medium, or large sections with the right divisi ratios.\n\nLASS also features solo instruments performed by the section leaders. Rather than sounding like ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´guest soloists,ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ these instruments sound like the first chair players they actually are, blending perfectly with the sections they come from.\n\nThe players are recorded in position on the scoring stage and mixed in the traditional orchestral seating perspective, making it simple to get a magnificent string mix out of the box. Meanwhile we took the utmost care to ensure that the instruments can be panned anywhere with virtually no phasing problems should you need to do that.\n\nAnd to make it easy to get just the right sound, all LASS patches and programming are consistent from the first chair to the full mix. If a part sounds right using the first chair patch, the same sequence will sound right with the full ensemble ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ no MIDI reprogramming required.\n\nThe result is unprecedented control over dynamics, performance, and section size.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3062dd80792c3f1c9090d8af8c224ddbd93b227a","amp;dn":"AudioBro+LA+Scoring+Strings+DVD_3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3062dd80792c3f1c9090d8af8c224ddbd93b227a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,98,221,128,121,44,63,28,144,144,216,175,140,34,77,219,217,59,34,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
