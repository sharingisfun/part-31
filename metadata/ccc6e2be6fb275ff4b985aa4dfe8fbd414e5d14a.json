GALAK-Z is a modern, A.I. and physics-driven open-world action game, viewed through the lens of the classic 16-bit space shooter. Powered by the next-generation Cyntient AI platform, GALAK-Z puts players in control of anime-inspired spacecraft inhabiting procedurally generated worlds.\r\nIn GALAK-Z both stealth and skill are required to defeat truly intelligent enemies. You will be forced to outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots! Master your shipâ€™s sublimely-honed controls as you blast enemies, unleash missile salvos, and even toss your opponents, mech-style, to their explosive demise.\r\nNew features include Arcade Mode which lets you replay failed missions any number of times without losing all of your saved progress. Rogue Mode retains GALAK-Zâ€™s original white-knuckle roguelite challenge that harkens back to the 16-bit era of gaming. Rogue mode will always be available if and when youâ€™re looking to test your skill and bravery by putting everything on the line, every mission.\r\nPlayers will be forced to outmaneuver, outgun and outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots. Both stealth and skill are required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse.
