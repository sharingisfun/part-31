Bluegrass Festival In The Sky\n \n(from the liner notes):\nYears before Emmylou Harris saluted bluegrass music with 'Roses In The Snow', years before the advents of Ricky Skaggs and Alison Krauss and many years before 'O Brother Where Art Thou?', there was 'The Magnificent Music Machine'.\n \nAlthough little noted at the time or for that matter, since, this was one of the most important recordings of bluegrass ever issued by a mainstream country star. By 1976, when this album appeared, Tom T. Hall was one of Nashville's biggest hit makers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd791dadf88ffb5401fda495e74bd914c7857c9","amp;dn":"Tom+T.+Hall+-+The+Mag.+Music+Machine+%281976%29+MP3+320kbps+%28WCS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd791dadf88ffb5401fda495e74bd914c7857c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,215,145,218,223,136,255,181,64,31,218,73,94,116,189,145,76,120,87,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
