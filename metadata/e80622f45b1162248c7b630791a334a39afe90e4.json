Technology has created a tectonic shift in the everyday experience of color. Colored light, once a limited area of interest to designers, is now the primary medium of the studio workplace. Color is a whole new world, and at times a very confusing one.\n\nThis is a book for everyone who uses color. It is written for design students and sign painters, architects and carpet salespeople, graphic designers and magicians. It is a roadmap to the relationships between colors, and even more, to the relationships between real colors and virtual colors. It is guide to using color freely, comfortably, and creatively without dependence on complicated theories or systems.\n\n\n\n\nBy Linda Holtzschue\nPublished by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80622f45b1162248c7b630791a334a39afe90e4","amp;dn":"Understanding+Color+%284th+Ed%29%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80622f45b1162248c7b630791a334a39afe90e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,6,34,244,91,17,98,36,140,123,99,7,145,163,52,163,154,254,144,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
