The encyclopedia also contains a lengthy bibliography, a list of Internet resources, a chronological listing of notable quakes and eruptions, and a handful of unforgettable eyewitness accounts (after the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, apparently Pliny the Elder's party went out &quot;having pillows tied upon their heads with napkins; and this was their whole defense against the storm of stones that fell around them&quot;).\n\nWith its clear, newspaper-style entries, the Encyclopedia of Earthquakes and Volcanoes will be navigable even to geo-newbies, but its a-to-z organization makes it more useful as a reference than as a stand-alone text. (Then again, given its liberal cross-referencing, you can easily find yourself led to a long, enjoyable read.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:123b852b2695459bb3b727600e9b8e9d193160f5","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Earthquakes+And+Volcanoes%2C3rd+Ed+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"123b852b2695459bb3b727600e9b8e9d193160f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,59,133,43,38,149,69,155,179,183,39,96,14,155,142,157,25,49,96,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
