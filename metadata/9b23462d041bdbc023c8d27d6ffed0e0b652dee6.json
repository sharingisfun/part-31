In the film, he sings it in a duet with Marjorie Reynolds. The song went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Though Marjorie Reynolds was the actress playing Linda Mason, her voice was dubbed by Martha Mears for the movie, and in the script as originally conceived, Reynolds, not Crosby, was to sing the song.\n\n&quot;White Christmas&quot; topped the &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; chart and remained in that position until well into the new year. (It has often been noted that the mix of melancholy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;just like the ones I used to know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with comforting images of home ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;where the treetops glisten&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ resonated especially strongly with listeners during World War II and the Armed Forces Network was flooded with requests for it.) In 1942 alone, the song spent eleven weeks on top of the charts. It returned to the #1 spot again during the holiday seasons of 1945 and 1946 (on the chart dated January 4, 1947), thus becoming the only single in history with three separate runs at the top of the U.S. charts. Eventually, Crosby&amp;#039;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; single sold more than 50 million copies. The Guinness Book of World Records currently lists the song as a 100-million seller (this encompassing all versions of the song, including on albums).\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b23462d041bdbc023c8d27d6ffed0e0b652dee6","amp;dn":"Bing+Crosby+-+White+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b23462d041bdbc023c8d27d6ffed0e0b652dee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,35,70,45,4,27,219,192,35,200,210,125,111,254,208,224,182,82,222,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
