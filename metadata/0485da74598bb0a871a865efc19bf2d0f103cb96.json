Often with hilarious results.\n\nEpisode 2 - Despite some idiosyncratic views on the matter, Michael finally learns to drive, thanks to a colourful array of instructors.\n\nEpisode 3 - Michael Holroyd describes the pleasures of driving a Daf, and the danger of doing so in Northern Ireland. And he gives a taste of Bernard Shaw's individualistic approach to driving.\n\nEpisode 4 - Michael Holroyd explains the delight the Bloomsbury set took in motor cars, both as objects of desire and locations for illicit assignations.\n\nEpisode 5 - Playwright Bernard Shaw was an enthusiastic driver - best avoided, and only thwarted by the outbreak of war. Michael Holroyd is defeated by his satnav.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0485da74598bb0a871a865efc19bf2d0f103cb96","amp;dn":"On+Wheels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0485da74598bb0a871a865efc19bf2d0f103cb96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,133,218,116,89,139,176,168,113,168,101,239,193,155,242,208,241,3,203,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
