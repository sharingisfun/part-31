On Badlands, the band worked again with producer Tony Braunagel at his Ultratone Studios in California. The drummer in the Phantom Blues Band, Braunagel plays some percussion on the album and recruited veteran keyboardist Mike Finnigan (Jimi Hendrix, Taj Mahal) to play keys. Johnny Lee Schell, who also recorded the album, adds acoustic guitar to one track and Lisa Swedelund provides some additional backing vocals. John Porter mixed the final results at Independent Street Studios in New Orleans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e05db9e505e229387f6f481b312238d37d6655c","amp;dn":"Trampled+Under+Foot+-+Badlands+%28flac%29+%5BMetalZero%5D%5BEccles%5D+%28Size%3A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e05db9e505e229387f6f481b312238d37d6655c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,5,219,158,80,94,34,147,135,246,244,129,179,18,35,141,55,214,101,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
