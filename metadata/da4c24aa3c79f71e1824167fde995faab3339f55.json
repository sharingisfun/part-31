Mac should also be fine with this, although I do not have and do not want a Mac to test this with.\n\nFor those limited to 1.5GB RAM option:\nYou MUST use 64bit Java to allow more than 1.5GB memory usage. This is not up to me. It is a limitation of Java and I cannot work around this. \n\nThis update fixes various minor issues present in the previous release as well as the most recent issue (a major one) relating to Mojang relocating some of their files, breaking client updates.\n\nemail: 6.forty AT\njabber: 6.forty AT jabber.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4c24aa3c79f71e1824167fde995faab3339f55","amp;dn":"Technic+Launcher+cracked+%28Updated+Dec+11%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4c24aa3c79f71e1824167fde995faab3339f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,76,36,170,60,121,247,30,24,36,22,127,222,153,95,170,179,51,159,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
