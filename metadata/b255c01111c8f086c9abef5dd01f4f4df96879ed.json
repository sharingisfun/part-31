Whether it's encountering cupcakes that spring to life, befriending potted flowers, or exploring the mysterious ruins on the island, this small boy in his hooded, footy pajamas always ends up having a blast with his friends. The debut graphic novel, simply titled YAM, is anchored by the full-length story &quot;Toy with My Dreams,&quot; in which Yam develops a crush on a girl much too old for him, but ends up being able to communicate with her in his dreams. The graphic novel also contains a full-color section and several short stories which have seen print in Nickelodeon Magazine.
