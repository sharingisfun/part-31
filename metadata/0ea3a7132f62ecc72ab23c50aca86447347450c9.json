Flashbacks return from DiRT 2, which can be used up to five times in any difficulty, but cost reputation points to use. A new gymkhana mode puts players in obstacle courses, challenging them to perform various tricks to earn points. Featured in the game are various party modes, involving events such as smashing wooden targets, spreading a zombie infection, and capture the flag. Other new features include a Hardcore mode which limits players to the cockpit view with no assists, the appearance of rain and snow, and the ability to upload replay clips directly to Youtube.\n\n\nIGN gave the game a score of 8.5 and an Editor's Choice award, praising the gameplay and online functionality whilst criticising some of the design choices.[5] GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.2, praising the gameplay and presentation, although criticising the limits of the Youtube functionality.[6] GamesRadar gave the game 9/10, praising its impeccable gameplay though noting slightly lower structure presentation compared to the previous game\n\n\nseed comment n enjoy!!!...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea3a7132f62ecc72ab23c50aca86447347450c9","amp;dn":"Dirt+3+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BRegion+Free%5D%5BXBOX360%5D%5Bsneak_shot%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea3a7132f62ecc72ab23c50aca86447347450c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,163,167,19,47,98,236,199,42,178,60,80,172,168,100,71,52,116,80,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
