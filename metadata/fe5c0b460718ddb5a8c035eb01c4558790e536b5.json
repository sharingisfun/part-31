The band was officially formed in 1986, although some date the band to bedroom tape experiments from 1982.[1][2] The band&amp;#039;s output is usually referred to as noise rock or sometimes Japanoise, though their more recent records have been largely based around repetitive minimalism, ambient music, and tribal drumming.\n\nThe band has a vast and sometimes confusing discography. Many band members have rotated through the group over the years, often using a number of various stage names. Singer Yamantaka Eye is the closest the band has to a frontman; his style includes a range of baffling screams, babbling, electronic effects, and very heavy post-production. Drummer/singer/trumpeter Yoshimi P-We has also featured on most Boredoms recordings.&quot;\n\n-from wiki\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5c0b460718ddb5a8c035eb01c4558790e536b5","amp;dn":"Boredoms+-+Pop+Tatari+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5c0b460718ddb5a8c035eb01c4558790e536b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,92,11,70,7,24,221,181,168,192,53,235,1,196,85,135,144,229,54,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
