Legends do not tell of the despairing Roman soldiers, abandoned by their empire, faced with the choice of fleeing back to Rome, or struggling to create a last stronghold against the barbarian onslaughts from the north and east. Legends do not tell of Arthur's great-grandfather, Publius Varrus, the warrior who marked the boundaries of a reborn empire with his own shed blood; they do not tell of Publius's wife, Luceiia, British-born and Roman-raised, whose fierce beauty burned pale next to her passion for law and honor.\nWith The Camulod Chronicles, Jack Whyte tells us what legend has forgotten: the history of blood and violence, passion and steel, out of which was forged a great sword, and a great nation. The Singing Sword continues the gripping epic begun in The Skystone: As the great night of the Dark Ages falls over Roman Britain, a lone man and woman fight to build a last stronghold of law and learning - a crude hill-fort, which one day, long after their deaths, will become a great city...known as Camelot.\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\nOverall bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 40.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nSampling rate : 16.0 KHz\n\nEncoded by : sum1 here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5848bcbe61970a9d224a8a8937a20132bc27d730","amp;dn":"The+Singing+Sword+Camulod+Chronicles%2C+Book+2+%28AudioBook%29+-+sum1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5848bcbe61970a9d224a8a8937a20132bc27d730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,72,188,190,97,151,10,157,34,74,138,137,55,162,1,50,188,39,215,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
