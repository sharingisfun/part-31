Bored by the sleepy life provided by their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon, the three British friends began playing music together. They started the first incarnation of their band while only 13 years old, changing the name of the group from Gothic Plague to Fixed Penalty to Rocket Baby Dolls as time passed. By 1997, the bandmates settled on the name Muse and released their self-titled debut EP on Dangerous Records, followed by the Muscle Museum EP in 1998. The group's emotive, passionate sound and live presence drew critical acclaim and industry buzz, and Muse signed a deal with Maverick Records after a trip to New York's CMJ festival. The singles &quot;Cave&quot; and &quot;Uno&quot; preceded their debut full-length album, Showbiz, which was released toward the end of 1999. Two years later, Muse issued The Origin of Symmetry and had a major hit with &quot;Hyper Music,&quot; which helped propel the album to platinum status in the U.K.\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\tLDB 5129-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.88% CDDA &amp; 99.80% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Starlight\n02.Sunburn\n03.New Born\n04.Sing For Absolution\n05.Muscle Museum\n06.Bliss\n07.City Of Delusion\n08.Apocalypse Please\n09.Space Dementia\n10.Uno\n11.Time Is Running Out\n12.Supermassive Black Hole\n13.Fillip\n14.Stockholm Syndrome\n15.Hyper Music\n16.Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes\n17.Hysteria\n18.Megalomania\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Take A Bow\n02.Knights Of Cydonia\n03.Easily\n04.Shrinking Universe\n05.Plug In Baby\n06.Cave\n07.Assassin\n08.Dead Star\n09.Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist\n10.Micro Cuts\n11.Showbiz\n12.The Small Print\n13.Nature\n14.Sober\n15.Jimmy Kane\n16.Overdue\n17.Coma\n18.Pink Ego Box\n19.Twin\n20.Hyper Chondriac Music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It!****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f74755a7c05deee5b131eeb76c7ac5f4cce8a01","amp;dn":"Muse+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f74755a7c05deee5b131eeb76c7ac5f4cce8a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,116,117,90,124,5,222,238,91,19,30,235,118,199,172,95,76,206,138,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
