Kramer (1969)\n\n\nLANGUAGE: English\nSUBTITLES: French (Hard)\n\n\nSYNOPSIS:A pioneering work that blurred the boundaries between fictional and documentary styles, Ice was hailed by filmmaker and Village Voice critic Jonas Mekas as &quot;the most original and most significant American narrative film&quot; of the late sixties. An underground revolutionary group struggles against internal strife which threatens its security and stages urban guerrilla attacks against a fictionalized fascist regime in the United States. Interspersed throughout the narrative are rhetorical sequences that explain the philosophy of radical action and serve to restrain the melodrama inherent in the &quot;thriller&quot; genre. Shot in the gray landscape of New York City in a gritty cinema-veritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© style, the film has been compared to Jean-Luc GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Alphaville. -- Harvard Film Series ( http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000janfeb/kramer.html )\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064465/\nRATING: 6.2/10 73 votes\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,334,474,752\nRuntime ...............: 02:07:45\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD \nFrame Size ............: 720 x 544\nFPS ...................: 25\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1223 kbps\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/sets/72157625639905758/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/sets/72157625639905758/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
