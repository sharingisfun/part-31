Download if you haven't heard it before! =)\n\nAll tunes are VBR ~200 kbps true stereo.\n\n\nReview from Amazon.com:\n\nWhen Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland started distributing homemade singles around Los Angeles at the beginning of the '90s, their bass-fortified, hard-rolling techno concoctions perked up the ears of industry impresarios and local scenesters alike. Vegas, their affectionately-titled major label debut, refines the formula. Thick with layers of pounding beats and rock dynamics, it takes the typical club fare and beefs it up with a uniquely western slant. The detectable influences range from the power chords of AC/DC to old school hip-hop patterns to the smooth melodies of Stevie Wonder. On blistering tracks like &quot;Trip Like I Do&quot; and &quot;Keep Hope Alive,&quot; the Crystal Method confirm that America has become a force of contention in the electronica field. --Aidin Vaziri","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d38c4e02198fa42b2270fbb99b7ebceb7b582ab","amp;dn":"The+Crystal+Method-Vegas-1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d38c4e02198fa42b2270fbb99b7ebceb7b582ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,56,196,224,33,152,250,66,178,39,15,187,153,183,235,206,183,181,130,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
