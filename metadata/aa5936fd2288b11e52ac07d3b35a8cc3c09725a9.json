It said something about a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœround-tu-itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; and we, as kids, used to think it was funny to read. For a while we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand just what it meaning was, until granddad said, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where everything goes, that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get done. Even funnier, how true it was and as I grew up, I realised that most people can live their lives in this way. They leave lots of things out of their live and give themselves some feeble excuses to never move forward in that particular area.\n\nI find Ã¢â‚¬ËœprocrastinatingÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ one of the most fascinating processes that people experience. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a kind of being in limbo land and not going anywhere at all; only justifying situations with excuses not to take action. Harsh it may seem, but it is actually harder to stay where we are than to do something about it. Why? You may ask, well, a simple example is that of a recent client who wanted to feel less stressed. He could find all the reasons to continue as he was: He said he needed to do a certain amount of chores each day in order to keep up to date with his job and home life. So, in the clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, he was stuck and Ã¢â‚¬ËœhadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœget things doneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. He felt helpless, very stressed and unhappy. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until I pointed out that he was finding all the excuses he could to stay where he was, when he finally realised he needed to prioritize. With the regular listening of my relaxation CD he was able to rearrange his lifestyle and actually ended up doing the same amount of work, but in a different order. He also wrote to me last week telling me about the plans he had made with his life and how much happier he is now; he even has time for his favourite hobby, gardening.\n\nLittle did I realise as a child, when people see those old Ã¢â‚¬Ëœround-tu-itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plates, they probably secretly say to themselves, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœoh yes, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what happensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they completely agree with it. Actually, owning such a thing is like saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and if it is okay, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine by me. However, if you really want to move on in your life and accomplish more, use our overcome procrastination hypnosis CD or MP3 download and experience more.\n\nSo next time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re thinking of doing something and it keeps getting put to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbottom of the pileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; remember, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s you thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing it, no one else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5936fd2288b11e52ac07d3b35a8cc3c09725a9","amp;dn":"Overcome+Procrastination+Hypnosis+-+Barrie+St.+John","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5936fd2288b11e52ac07d3b35a8cc3c09725a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,89,54,253,34,136,177,30,82,172,7,211,179,90,140,195,192,151,37,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
