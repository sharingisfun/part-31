His fascination with the healing powers of art fuels a journey that opens a new perspective on one of Britain's most famous men.\n\nAndrew travels to the south of France and Marrakech, where Churchill loved to paint, and discovers how his serious approach to the craft of painting led to friendships with major British artists of the 20th century. He finds out how a single painting in the 1940s may have influenced the course of the Second World War, and meets Churchill's descendants to discover what his family felt about a private hobby that helped keep him sane through his wilderness years. And he discovers how, 50 years after Churchill's death, his art is being taken more seriously than ever before, with one painting being sold for almost Ã‚Â£2 million in 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3964ec9348b29ac0af2b87787cd4cbf067747ee9","amp;dn":"Andrew+Marr+on+Churchill+EN+SUBS+x265+720p+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3964ec9348b29ac0af2b87787cd4cbf067747ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,100,236,147,72,178,154,192,175,43,135,120,124,212,203,240,103,116,126,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
