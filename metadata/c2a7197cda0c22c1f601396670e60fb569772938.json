Garcia in 1996.\n\nIn the beginning, Against The Grain's metallic sound derived as a 1980's crossover style in which their 7-song 1996 Demo sounded similar to Agnostic Front's Cause For Alarm album, due largely to Rob Kabula's influence and Billy Milano managing and producing the band. \n\n1998 saw Against The Grain put out their first full-length 17-song cd entitled Mentiroso. The sound on Mentiroso represented a more raw old school hardcore sound with a touch of oi, punk, and but only a small metal influence. A.G.'s vocals changed, going from a deep growl to a more straight up raspy clearer legible style. The band would quickly move away from the trendy metal sound which they felt over-saturated the New York Hardcore scene and their music would become much shorter derivative of the old school type hardcore bands. Special guest vocals on Mentiroso include Roger Miret of Agnostic Front and Billy Milano of SOD/MOD.\n\nMore information about the band can be found at:  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a7197cda0c22c1f601396670e60fb569772938","amp;dn":"Against+The+Grain-Mentiroso+%28Remastered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a7197cda0c22c1f601396670e60fb569772938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,167,25,124,218,12,34,193,246,1,57,102,112,230,15,181,105,119,41,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
