The police who investigate \ncrime, and the Crown Prosecutors who prosecute the offenders. These are \ntheir stories. \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLaw &amp; Order: UK is based in London and duplicates the episode format of \nthe original series. The first half focuses on the perpetration of a crime \nand the related police investigation typically culminating in an arrest, \nwhile the second half follows the legal and court proceedings in an effort \nto convict the suspect.[5] The show dwells little on the characters' \nback-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800295f66031e0aa8d5e0680348c2efd7e10f1af","amp;dn":"law+and+order+uk+s02e01-04+bia+c4tv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800295f66031e0aa8d5e0680348c2efd7e10f1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,2,149,246,96,49,224,170,141,94,6,128,52,140,46,253,126,16,241,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
