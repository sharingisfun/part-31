Zoltar brings the underground to you in Subterranean.\n\nNotes: Bet Y'all having been missing your NFOs? Any, in Live Recorded Events (TV Shows, now Radio Shows), I omit them -- If you really want to read a Desc, you can look it up on imdb like I do; it all adds up to a faster release for you. This, however is a special occasion, 1st XM rip. Please respond with XM Shows you'd want to hear - Talk, DJ Mixes, whatever. At this point I am planning on doing Tiesto's Club Life, State of Trance, and Coast to Coast AM.
