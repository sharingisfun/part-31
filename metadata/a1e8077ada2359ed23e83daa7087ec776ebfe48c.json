He was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the power, honesty and deep-felt emotions of his dramatic works, which embody an original concept of tragedy.&quot;\n\nO'Neill helped to introduce into American drama techniques of realism earlier associated with Chekhov, Ibsen, and Strindberg.  His plays were among the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society, where they struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair.  Nearly all of his plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.  LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT (1956), widely considered to be his masterwork, is often numbered on the short list of being among the finest American plays in the 20th century alongside &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.\n\nAnchored by the first two volumes of the marvellous Library of America edition, and with the sole exception of &quot;The Calms of Capricorn&quot;, this collection includes all 50 of O'Neill's full-length and one-act plays.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n* COMPLETE PLAYS, 1913-1920 (Library of America, 1988).
