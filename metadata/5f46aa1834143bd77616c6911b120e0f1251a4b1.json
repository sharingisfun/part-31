In a unique way, they sang a cappella versions of  classical music. The group, directed originally by the American Ward Swingle, began as session singers mainly doing background vocals for singers such as Charles Aznavour and Edith Piaf. \n\nThey also did some jazz vocals for Michel Legrand, whose sister Christiane was a prominent soprano in the group. The eight session singers sang through Bach's Well-Tempered Klavier as a sight reading exercise and found the music to have a natural swing.\n \nThey recorded their first album Jazz SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bastien Bach as a present for friends and relatives. Many radio stations picked it up and this led to the group recording more albums and winning a total of five Grammy Awards. \n\nThe French group disbanded in 1973, but Ward Swingle moved to London and formed a new Swingle Singers, who are still going strong.\n\nThe recordings on this compilation are from three records:\nTracks 1 to 13 are from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBachs Greatest HitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1963)*\nTracks 13 to 23 are from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack to BachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1968)**\nThe bonus tracks 24 and 25 are the Bach tunes from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlace VendomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1966)*** \n\n 1.&quot;Fugue in D Minor&quot;, Contrapunctus 9 from The Art of the Fugue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14\n 2.&quot;Prelude for Organ Chorale No. 1&quot; (Choral-Prelude BWV 645 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n 3.&quot;Aria&quot; from Suite No 3 in D (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAir for G StringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½)  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n 4.&quot;Prelude No 12 in F Minor&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12\n 5.&quot;BourrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e II&quot; from The English Suite No 2&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n 6.&quot;Fugue No 2 in C Minor&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:16\n 7.&quot;Fugue No 5 in D&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:38\n 8.&quot;Prelude No 9 in E&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n 9.&quot;Sinfonia&quot; from The Partita No 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n10.&quot;Prelude No 1 in C&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:56\n11.&quot;Canon&quot; (4-Part Canon BWV 1073) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:53\n12.&quot;Two Part Invention No 1 in C&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:22\n13.&quot;Fugue No 5 in D&quot; from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n14.&quot;Vivace&quot; from Concerto for 2 violins, strings &amp; continuo in D minor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n15.&quot;Prelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 10 in E minor&quot; (WTC I), BWV 855 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n16.&quot;Choral&quot; from Cantata No. 147, &quot;Jesus bleibet meine FreudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ BWV 147 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n17.&quot;Gavotte&quot; from Partita for solo violin No. 3 in E major, BWV 1006 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n18.&quot;Prelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 1 in C major&quot; (WTC I), BWV 846 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n19.&quot;Fugue&quot; from Prelude and Fugue, for organ in G major, BWV 541 (BC J22) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n20.&quot;Adagio&quot; from Sonata for violin &amp; keyboard No. 3 in E major, BWV 1016 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n21.&quot;Prelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 3 in C sharp major&quot; (WTC I), BWV 848 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n22.&quot;Prelude&quot; from &quot;Nun komm der Heiden Heiland&quot; (II), BWV 659 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n23.&quot;Prelude and Fugue, for keyboard No. 21 in B flat major&quot;, BWV 866 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:24\n\nBonus tracks:\n24.&quot;Ricercare ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  6&quot; (from &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:29\n25.&quot;Air for G String&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n\n\nVocals:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Jeanette Baucomont ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ soprano \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Christiane Legrand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ soprano \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Claudine Meunier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Ward Swingle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor, arranger \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Claude Germain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Jean Cussac ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Jean Claude Briodin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (*)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Devos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto (**)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Alice Herald ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto (***)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Anne Germain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alto (*)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Joseph Noves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor (**)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Germain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (**&amp;***)\n\nRhythm section:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Pierre Michelot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ double bass (*&amp;**)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Guy Pedersen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ double bass (***)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Bernard Lubat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (*)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Daniel Humair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (*)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Gus Wallez ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (**)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Arpino ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (**)\n\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet (***)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f46aa1834143bd77616c6911b120e0f1251a4b1","amp;dn":"The+Swingle+Singers+-+Jazz+Sebastian+Bach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f46aa1834143bd77616c6911b120e0f1251a4b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,70,170,24,52,20,59,215,118,22,198,145,27,18,14,15,18,81,164,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
