In his anger, Sweeney goes on a murderous rampage on all London, with the help of Mrs. Lovett, he opens a barber shop in which he lures his victims in with a charming smile before casually ending their life with a flick of his razor across their neck. But not one man killed, nor ten thousands men can satisfy Sweeney&amp;#039;s lust for revenge on those who&amp;#039;ve caused his years of pain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fb0325a8a67995e226dffca85f61e40ede3a9a","amp;dn":"Sweeney.Todd-The.Demon.Barber.Of.Fleet.Street%5BDvdrip%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fb0325a8a67995e226dffca85f61e40ede3a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,251,3,37,168,166,121,149,226,38,223,252,168,95,97,228,14,222,58,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
