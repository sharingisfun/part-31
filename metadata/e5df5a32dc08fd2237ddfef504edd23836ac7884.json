After showing the origins of fundamentalism, he examines representative anti-Catholic groups and presents their arguments in their own words. His rebuttals are clear, detailed, and charitable. Special emphasis is given to the scriptural basis for Catholic doctrines and beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease seed!\r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/catholicstuff/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5df5a32dc08fd2237ddfef504edd23836ac7884","amp;dn":"Karl+Keating+-+Catholicism+and+Fundamentalism+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5df5a32dc08fd2237ddfef504edd23836ac7884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,223,90,50,220,8,253,34,55,221,254,245,4,237,210,56,54,172,120,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
