The straightforward, interactive style of this book makes it ideal for home electronics work and particularly suitable as an introduction to university lab courses for students who are not familiar with hands-on electronics construction. The book also lends itself as a self-contained resource for secondary school and vocational course classroom projects.\n\n* Master the practical techniques of electronics construction, from using a soldering iron to etching a printed circuit board, and mounting the finished product in a case\n* Apply practical electronics skills through a series of simple self-build projects\n* A bench reference guide to selecting and using the right tools, techniques and components, whatever your project\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 320 pages\n    * Publisher: Newnes (October 6, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0750667362\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0750667364","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955f01ad5947ea77e2e7467ed4904308974fa326","amp;dn":"Starting+Electronics+Construction%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955f01ad5947ea77e2e7467ed4904308974fa326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,95,1,173,89,71,234,119,226,231,70,126,212,144,67,8,151,79,163,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
