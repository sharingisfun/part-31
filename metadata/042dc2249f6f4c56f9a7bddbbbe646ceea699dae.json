(a.k.a. Christopher Wallace), who came straight out of Brooklyn to take the world of rap music by storm.\n\nNOTES:\nRight this is a mixture of versions to bring to you a complete version with full audio :)\nThe .iso i got was pretty good and had better colouring/contrast then the lynks version.....however it was heavily cropped,so \ni opted for the lynks version for the main bulk of the film.....Which i might add was another top release by them ;-)\nAnyway quality wise......the picture on both sources were great for cams.....don't get much better then these (well not nowadays anyway).\nThe audio was good on both,but both cams the .iso probably had slightly better audio...but there was too much in it and not enough to \nwarrant a re-sync.\n\nWORK DONE:\nThe important thing was to split the ending off the .iso and add it to lynks release......\nAfter this i notice a small glitch around the 28 min mark on lynks version (well on my download anyway)....so i needed to use another programme \naswell for this ...my xpress wouldn't have it :(\nOnce sorted i slightly tweaked the colours,contrast etc......not to much though as it was good anyway.\nOh also used a contour filter to sharpen the picture up a touch  more aswell\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-515379.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-515379.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-515478.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-515478.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-517281.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-517281.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-518398.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-518398.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-520285.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stuffie.takagari.com/notorious/vlcsnap-520285.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042dc2249f6f4c56f9a7bddbbbe646ceea699dae","amp;dn":"Notorious+CAM+XVID+-+STG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042dc2249f6f4c56f9a7bddbbbe646ceea699dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,45,194,36,159,111,76,86,249,167,189,219,187,230,70,206,234,105,157,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
