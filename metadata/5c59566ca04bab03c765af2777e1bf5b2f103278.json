What followed was a stretch of exploration and experimentation \nwithin the many and various realms of music. Before long, Arnej settled into Euro dance,\neventually stumbling upon Psy and Goa trance in the mid-90ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. He devoted his attention \nto the works of Man With No Name, Astral Projection and Hallucinogen.\n\nAt that time, the trance sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which he would grow so passionate about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was still in \nthe process of establishing an identity. By the late 90ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s though, trance had thoroughly\ncarved out its niche in the music world and ArnejÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest in it expanded accordingly.\nEntranced by its complex soundscapes and harmonies, he set about taking the journey into \nmusic production. Although the road of a producer has had its fair share of bumps and curves,\nArnejÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commitment to his craft shows no sign of slowing up, as as evidenced by his \never-growing body of work.\n\nSome of his more notable and successful tracks include: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Rendezvous,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Ones That Get Away,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Return,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“They Always Come BackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Strangers We Have Become,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ all of which have gotten \npositive support from the DJ elite, given exposure by such notable as Armin van Buuren, Ferry \nCorsten, Judge Jules, David Guetta, and Paul Oakenfold, among many others.\n\nArnej has also remixed for some of the most-respected names in trance, including Armin, The \nThrillseekers, Mr. Sam, Blake Jarrell and Push, aka M.I.K.E, as well as some of the newer names \nin trance to pop up in recent years, Evgeny Bardyuzha, Mike Saint-Jules, and Dash Berlin.\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
