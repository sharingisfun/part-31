The mp3s circulated as demos and created quite a stir amongst C! fans, and ultimately caused much disappointment with PRF. Why disappointment? Simply put, these songs are superior (and I liked PRF a whole bunch!). \n \n I think part of the appeal of many of these tracks is the re-emergence of pop-culture landmarks referenced throughout, harkening back to their benchmark self-titled release. You've got reference to TV's classic mini-series V in Oregon for crying out loud, and the Cover Girl jingle in Easy Breeze! This absurdity is part of the fascination I have with Clutch. They always had a way of tying familiar topics into heavy, catchy jams. Who kicks a jam that talks about harpsichords? Clutch does. \n\n Track Listing....: \n 01.Slow hole to china [03:21] \n 02.Nickel dime [03:00] \n 03.Sea of destruction [02:50] \n 04.Oregon [05:24] \n 05.Easy breeze [02:41] \n 06.Four lords (and one more) [03:04] \n 07.Rising son [04:02] \n 08.Guild of mute assassins [06:42] \n 09.Willie nelson [03:17] \n 10.Equinox [03:56] \n 11.Hoodoo operator [04:57] \n 12.Day of the jackalope [03:35] \n ____ \n \n 46:49 min \n 76,7 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13e81f08f1e208ec83ba8770fbff5257069cffb","amp;dn":"Clutch-Slow_Hole_To_China-%28Retail%29-2003-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13e81f08f1e208ec83ba8770fbff5257069cffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,62,129,240,143,30,32,142,200,59,168,119,15,191,245,37,112,105,207,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
