Here, Jane shares her experiences of looking after her chronically ill husband with Nora EphronÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike wit, and offers practical guidance for handling it all without drowning. With advice on staying healthy while caring for a loved one and learning to communicate with medical staff, plus wisdom from other caregivers and experts, this is a personal and invaluable tool kit that also manages to prompt laughter and inspire. For the more than 65 million caregivers in the US alone, this book couldn't be more timely or important.
