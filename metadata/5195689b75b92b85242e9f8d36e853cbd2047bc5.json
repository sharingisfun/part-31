Sixty-one young men were killed and as many wounded. The ambush prompted some in power to wonder whether the war might be unwinnable.\n\nHalf a world away, concerned students at the University of Wisconsin protested the presence of Dow Chemical recruiters on campus. When Madison police showed up, the demonstration spiraled out of control, marking the first time that a student protest had turned violent.\n\nTold entirely by the people who took part in the harrowing events of those two days -- American soldiers, police officers, relatives of men killed in battle, protesting students, university administrators and Viet Cong fighters -- the film offers a window onto a moment that divided a nation and a war that continues to haunt us.\n\nDVB\nDivX\nMP3 ABR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5195689b75b92b85242e9f8d36e853cbd2047bc5","amp;dn":"How+Vietnam+was+lost+%2F+Two+days+in+November","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5195689b75b92b85242e9f8d36e853cbd2047bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,149,104,155,117,185,43,133,36,46,159,141,54,232,83,203,210,4,123,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
