In a delightfully witty and fresh voice, James Wardâ€”cofounder of the Boring Conference and collector of the arcaneâ€”explores the secret histories of deskbound supplies, from pencils to fluorescent ink, and the gleaming reams of white paper we all take for granted, encouraging a deeper appreciation and fascination for the things that surround us each day.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of The Evolution of Useful Things and A History of the World in 100 Objects, Ward transforms the mundane into stories of invention, discovery, and even awe. The Perfection of the Paper Clip is a fascinating tour of the objects that touch our daily lives, filled with charming drawings, illuminating stories, and winning humor that will satisfy curious minds and armchair inventors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86a32e03b24db5c32df820aead34055d18c64be","amp;dn":"The+Perfection+of+the+Paper+Clip+-+James+Ward.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86a32e03b24db5c32df820aead34055d18c64be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,106,50,224,59,36,219,92,50,223,130,10,234,211,64,85,209,140,100,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
