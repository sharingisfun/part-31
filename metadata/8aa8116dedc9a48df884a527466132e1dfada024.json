The showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s producer had originally created a 5 year story arc and had filmed 2 different endings to the Season 2 finale depending on whether or not it was renewed for a 3rd season. Unfortunately it was cancelled after 2 seasons by Channel 7 Sydney which had commissioned the show and we all watched one version of the ending.\n\nHowever, it has now been picked up for a 3rd season by Foxtel AUST and so, we now have an alternate ending to view. The only difference is in the last 4 mins of the show. One scene has been reshot to show a different outcome, and there is also a brand new scene. This clip only shows the last few minutes that contain the differences to the original.\n\nLength:........4mins 51secs\nResolution.....716 x 400 pixels\nFrame Rate:....30 frames/second","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa8116dedc9a48df884a527466132e1dfada024","amp;dn":"A+Place+To+Call+Home+S02E10+Alternate+Ending","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa8116dedc9a48df884a527466132e1dfada024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,168,17,109,237,201,164,141,248,132,165,39,70,97,50,225,223,173,160,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
