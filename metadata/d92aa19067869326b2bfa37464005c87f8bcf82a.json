They first begun writing, recording and producing together in the year 2000. Together with SD, Shiesty B and DJ Chromek they formed the hiphop crew known as Domino Effect. Vertakill is known around the local scene for being an arrogant freestyle battler but quickly grew tired of it and moved his focus to writing rhymes and creating tracks. Mc Skitzofrenic spent the last 3-4 years in his home town of Perth making beats and writing raps. When Mc Skitzofrenic returned to Adelaide in Early 2006, Vertakill and he decided to combine their creative energies and work on a few music projects together, and so The Roach Scholars were born. They have a self titled 12 inch out and a full length CD completed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92aa19067869326b2bfa37464005c87f8bcf82a","amp;dn":"Roach+Scholars+-+Roaches+Of+The+Apocalypse+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92aa19067869326b2bfa37464005c87f8bcf82a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,42,161,144,103,134,147,38,178,191,163,116,100,0,92,135,248,188,248,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
