But his son Edmund did not want any other boy in the ugly, isolated Victorian house. It was his house, he was King here. But Kingshaw still came, with his bright, genteel mother. Hooper hated him. He was an intruder, to be subtly persecuted. Hooper learned fast how to turn the most ordinary object into a source of terror. Like a frightened animal, Kingshaw ran. In Hang Wood their roles were briefly reversed. But Kingshaw could not win, not in the last resort. He knew it, and so did Hooper. The worst was still to come. \n\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH AND BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE.\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed. Leechers remember, the community depends on you.
