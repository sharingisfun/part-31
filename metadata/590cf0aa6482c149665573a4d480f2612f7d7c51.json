By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well.\n\nWinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, ACE, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).\n\nWinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.\n\nWinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks for example.\n\nWinRAR is also ideal, if you are sending data through the web. Its 128 bit password encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.\n\nWinRAR is shareware, meaning you have the chance to thoroughly test it. The program can be used absolutely free of charge for 40 days.\n\nWinRAR licenses are valid for all available language and platform versions. If you have purchased several licenses, you can even mix versions to meet your own personal needs.\n\nWinRAR gives you all future UPDATES for FREE! Not like the competition that will make you pay again every one or two years\n\n*****************************************************\n\nWinZip is the original and most popular of all Windows ZIP file utilities. Wizard/Classic interfaces accommodate both first-time and experienced users.

WinZip 12 adds new features for JPEG compression, the ability to ZIP files directly from a digital camera, an enhanced thumbnail view, a built-in image viewer, support for the LZMA compression method, customizable password policies, more encyption options, and other new features.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nx N O T E x\nxxxxxxxxxxx                                                                     \n\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noALL my uploads scanned by NOD32 Antiviruso                            \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n                                                                      \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noThey WON'T be here if they never passo                                 \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo                                                                      \n\noooooooooooooooooooooo\noMore of my uploads :o\noooooooooooooooooooooo\n \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\no http://thepiratebay.se/user/kentucky-kid/ o\noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noAfter your download , please leave as much information aso\noyou can in the comments section                          o\nosuch as :                                                o\no                                                         o\no* Thank You (Encourage me) (^.^)                         o\no* How you managed to get it work (Steps you take)        o \no* What problems are you facing (State ur OS)             o\no* Other users who wants to help users who are            o\no  facing problems are most welcome                       o\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\noooooooooooooooo\no Seed &amp; Enjoy o\noooooooooooooooo\n\n*** ATTENTION ***\n\nMaybe some of you wanna come by and chat at my site. it's kind of a new forum site, whereby there are various kinds of sections/topics on gaming, jokes, pc softwares/hardwares, useful pc articles from various sources, discussions on worldwide affairs etc etc. Still, there's many more to come!\n\nThe latest new is the built-in live chat system(no irc) in the forum! it enables ALL users to chat and discuss on whatever they like.
