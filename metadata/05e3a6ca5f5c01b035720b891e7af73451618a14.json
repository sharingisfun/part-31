Sounding eerily American, Stingray should've been poised for international success, but fate had other plans. Though both albums had very strong chart activity in their homeland, there was no crossover success to support the band's long-range aspirations and the band split up after continuous frustration. Despite their short run in the business, Stingray have left behind a wealth of memorable and well written AOR songs. \n\nTracks:\nBetter The Devil You Know\nThe Man In My Shoes\nSame Old Party\nHow Much?\nBreakdown\nDevotion\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\nGonna Keep My Head Together\nLovesaver\nHard Headed Loner\nWhole Lotta Fire\nLucy\n\nBand members:\n-----------\nDennis East - vocals\nMike Pilot - guitars, vocals\nAllan Goldswain - keyboards\nDanny Anthill - keyboards, flute\nEddie Boyle - bass\nShaun Wright Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nFormat: 256kbps MP3\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO INFECTIONS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e3a6ca5f5c01b035720b891e7af73451618a14","amp;dn":"Stingray+-+Stingray+Revisited+and+Remastered+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e3a6ca5f5c01b035720b891e7af73451618a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,227,166,202,95,92,1,176,53,114,11,137,30,122,247,52,81,97,138,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
