The Count Bishops and MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead were also on the bill, but for contractual reasons MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead needed to perform under another name. Lemmy came up with the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell, part of which would later be used for the name of a studio album. \n\nChiswick Records boss Ted Carroll organised the Rolling Stones mobile truck to record the event and later released the album through his Big Beat Records label in 1983.  After that it has been re-released with other titles and/or other sleeves, amongst others as &quot;The Watcher&quot; in Canada, &quot;City Kids&quot;, &quot;Live, Loud and Lewd&quot; and &quot;Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abe610f3ec07551463684f5fb7c282909f16ed7f","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+What%5C%27s+Wordsworth+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abe610f3ec07551463684f5fb7c282909f16ed7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,230,16,243,236,7,85,20,99,104,79,95,183,194,130,144,159,22,237,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
