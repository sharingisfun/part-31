During World War I, inspired by the idea of a free and independent Latvia, about 60, 000 men volunteered for the battalions of riflemen. At the time when the film was made Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the beginning of the 80-ties Ã¢â‚¬â€œ about 300 were still alive, aged from 80 to 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Today, not a single one is left.  The film has captured unique and, by now, historical material, which does not have and will not have a contender.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad49580f87166ebad1a7057dc5c779617b273c39","amp;dn":"Str%C4%93lnieku+zvaigzn%C4%81js+%281982%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad49580f87166ebad1a7057dc5c779617b273c39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,73,88,15,135,22,110,186,209,167,5,125,197,199,121,97,123,39,60,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
