None of the songs are quite as strong as the best on their debut, but there is plenty of good music on the band&amp;#039;s much-delayed second record. The Stone Roses create a dense tapestry of interweaving guitars and pulsing bass grooves. Ian Brown growls a little more than before, but he isn&amp;#039;t the center of the music; John Squire&amp;#039;s endlessly colorful riffs are. It&amp;#039;s clear that Squire has been listening to a bit of hard rock, particularly Led Zeppelin. While the songs occasionally take a back seat to the grooves, several tracks -- &quot;Ten Storey Love Song,&quot; &quot;Begging You,&quot; &quot;Tightrope,&quot; &quot;How Do You Sleep,&quot; and &quot;Love Spreads&quot; -- rank as true classics. It might not be the long-awaited masterpiece it was rumored to be, but Second Coming is a fine sophomore effort.
