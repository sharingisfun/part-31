Yet after a week of being homeless, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reunited with her family. \n\nAt school, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful and popular. At home, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthy beyond her dreams. But she quickly realizes her perfect life is a lie. Her family is falling apart and her friends are snobby, cruel and plastic. Worse still, she discovers she was the cruelest one. \n\nMortified by her past, she embarks on a journey of redemption and falls for Kyle, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she once tormented. Yet all the time she wonders if, when her memories return, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll become the bully she was beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll lose Kyle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09fbfd718d36906f3a2cd263873c72aaba4cd4c","amp;dn":"Sia+by+Josh+Grayson+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09fbfd718d36906f3a2cd263873c72aaba4cd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,159,191,215,24,211,105,6,243,162,205,38,56,115,199,42,171,164,205,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
