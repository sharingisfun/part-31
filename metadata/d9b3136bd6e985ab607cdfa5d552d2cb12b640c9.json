His songs are fantastic works of art that must be heard.  He does several collabs, including an excellent one with Yhimself, entitled Alliance, it's my personal favorite.  Obsidia isn't very well known yet, but soon he will be.  His music is mindblowing, and is truly worth checking out.  \n\nTracklist:\n\nAlliance\nAndroid\nAnnihilate\nAnother World\nBeautiful\nDifferent \nDrops of Water\nEvolution\nFalling\nHeart of Darkness\nIgnition \nIllusion\nLost In Space\nMasquerade\nMetamorphosis\nOblivion \nOne Day \nOne Winged Angel\nResurrect\nTrickster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b3136bd6e985ab607cdfa5d552d2cb12b640c9","amp;dn":"The+Obsidia+Collection+%5BVolume+1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b3136bd6e985ab607cdfa5d552d2cb12b640c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,179,19,107,214,233,133,171,96,124,223,165,213,82,210,203,18,182,64,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
