Its treatment ranges from classical theorems of Menger and Schoenberg to recent developments such as approximation results for multicommodity flow and max-cut problems, metric aspects of Delaunay polytopes, isometric graph embeddings, and matrix completion problems. The discussion leads to many interesting subjects that cannot be found elsewhere, providing a unique and invaluable source for researchers and graduate students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff116d853e6ddffa55fc54ceef0f94769f214a81","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1997%5D+Geometry+of+Cuts+and+Metrics+%28Algorithms+and+Combin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff116d853e6ddffa55fc54ceef0f94769f214a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,17,109,133,62,109,223,250,85,252,84,206,239,15,148,118,159,33,74,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
