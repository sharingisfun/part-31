Not all of the Seine is navigable by rowing boat, so he sets sail into an unvarnished France on a variety of craft, hitching lifts in everything from a converted Parisian tourist boat to a sailing boat with no mast. He even tries out an amphibious vehicle.\n\nAlong the way he encounters Stephane (a carp fisherman with a very strange habit), grapples with rapids and stubborn cattle, rescues a couple when their sailing dinghy capsizes, and discovers that rowing in the dark is more frightening than he first thought.\n\n\n1/5 Charles Timoney attempts to find the source of the Seine - which proves rather difficult\n\n2/5 Charles takes his first purposeful strokes towards the Channel, travelling the Seine.\n\n3/5 Charles Timoney continues his journey along the Seine in a converted Parisian tourist boat\n\n4/5 Author Charles Timoney meets Stephane, a carp fisherman with a very strange habit.\n\n5/5 Continuing along the Seine, Charles Timoney tries out an amphicar and stops off in Rouen.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------File Information---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst broadcast: BBC R4, 10 to 14 June 2013\nType: MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 128 kbps mp3 - 44 khz - Joint Stereo\nDuration: 5 X 14 minutes episodes\nCaptured with Radio Downloader, edited with mp3DirectCut\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc1be1cb972f54e1c5ca0445a48e5b4e613e0ea","amp;dn":"An+Englishman+Aboard++-++Charles+Timoney+++%28BBC+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc1be1cb972f54e1c5ca0445a48e5b4e613e0ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,193,190,28,185,114,245,78,28,92,160,68,90,72,229,180,230,19,224,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
