From a drive down the highway or shopping in a grocery store to surfing the web and navigating our PDAs, we are bombarded by words in a plethora of shapes, sizes, and arrangements. It is essential for designers to understand the basics of typography to optimise this communication. This book provides a solid background in typographic knowledge for both print and digital media. Learning these details step-by-step will create a solid foundation in typography and will strengthen a designer's skill set for whatever career focus they may choose.\n\nAbout the author\nDenise Bosler is a graphic designer, illustrator, and professor of communication design at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania.
