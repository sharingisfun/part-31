It's a fascinating blend of autobiography and fiction with a sci-fi twist: in a seaside Australian town struggling with alien tentacle-creature immigration, a trio of aimless teenagers skip school to go surfing, chase rumors of a dead body, and avoid dealing with their own fears.\n\nHere's what Craig Thompson, author of Blankets and Habibi, has to say about Blue: \n\n&quot;This book rekindles my earliest enthusiasm for the comics medium. Pat Grant is the Australian Mark Twain, trading Huck's raft for a waxed-up surfboard and an inked-up sable brush. Vast themes of racism and immigration unravel in sprawling murals and a single day in the life of some reckless teens in this sea-polished, perfect nugget of a book.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:598fd65a290822ed855e8191aed885c8e46b7ea6","amp;dn":"Pat+Grant+-+Blue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"598fd65a290822ed855e8191aed885c8e46b7ea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,143,214,90,41,8,34,237,133,94,129,145,174,216,133,200,228,107,126,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
