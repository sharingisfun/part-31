I would like to change the name Rajneesh Foundation International. Sheela and her fascist gang have contaminated the name. I would like it to be Rajneesh Friends International. It remains RFI.\r\n\r\nRIMU and RA are two wings of RFI. RIMU is educational, intellectual, scholarly. Both are totally unique experiments because the degrees that you will get will not be of any use in the world...\r\n...............\r\nOsho is also explaining categories like SIDDHA , ARIHANTA , ACHARYA ...and ...\r\n&quot; The Academy has another section: MAHASATTVAS , SAMBUDDHAS , BODHISATTVAS . Their number is fixed, and each group will have a fixed number. That is part of the Academy's secret work...\r\n \r\nat the end Osho said:\r\n\r\n ...It is exactly twenty-five centuries after Buddha's death that I am changing the name of the Foundation so that it becomes Rajneesh Friends International. It is not only just a change of the name. It is going to change the very flavor of our whole movement. And you have to rise up so that what I want the movement to become, it becomes. So that the dream is realized.\r\nDon't let me down. Okay?&quot; \r\n\r\nAudios and books free download from oshoworld(dot)com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e17f031fb6b818917a14fd4770f8bb1de082160","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament_vol-3+%2323_Don%27t+let+me+down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e17f031fb6b818917a14fd4770f8bb1de082160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,23,240,49,251,107,129,137,23,161,79,212,119,15,139,177,222,8,33,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
