In their daily lives they experienced oppression and self-denial in the face of frequently unsympathetic local customs, but also empowerment, self-affirmation, and acculturation.  This volume not only deepens our understanding of the distinctive contributions that women have made to Balkan history but also re-evaluates this through a more inclusive and interdisciplinary analysis in which gender takes its place alongside other categories such as class, culture, religion, ethnicity and nationhood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b725645cda4b85a79d6561c21bf9381a93ce51f2","amp;dn":"Women+in+the+Ottoman+Balkans%3A+Gender%2C+Culture+and+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b725645cda4b85a79d6561c21bf9381a93ce51f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,37,100,92,218,75,133,167,157,101,97,194,27,249,56,26,147,206,81,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
