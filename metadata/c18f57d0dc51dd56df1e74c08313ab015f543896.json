At the last moment, he takes out a couple of knights and makes a run for it. One knight shoots another with an arrow and reveals himself as &quot;a friend.&quot; It's the Huntsman (Jamie Dornan). He tells the prince he doesn't know him, but he knows Snow White, and he sends Prince Charming on his way.\n\nIn Storybrooke, Henry (Jared Gilmore) is in the hospital and non-responsive. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) tells Dr. Whale (David Anders) the poisoned apple tart must have been the cause. He tells her Henry is showing now signs of neurotoxins. There is no explanation, he says. &quot;It's like&quot; he starts to say. Emma sees Henry's book of fairy tales and finishes the sentence to herself by saying, &quot;It's like magic.&quot;\n\nShe picks up the book and is jolted by its stories. Regina (Lana Parrilla) appears. Emma goes off on her. &quot;You did this,&quot; Emma says before slamming Regina around for a bit. Emma tells Regina that Henry ate the apple turnover. Regina confesses the turnover was meant for Emma. Regina also admits she used the last of her magic. She doesn't know what will happen to Henry because magic in Storybrooke is unpredictable.\n\nOnce Upon a Time (2011)\nTV Series  -  43min  -\nS01E22.HDTV.x264-LOL\nMay 13, 2012\n\n\n\nGenres:\nAdventure | Drama | Fantasy \n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish \n\n\nCreators:\nAdam Horowitz, Edward Kitsis\n\nStars:\nGinnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison and Lana Parrilla \t\n\n\n\n***************************\n\nFINAL EPISODE FOR THIS SEASON\nSEE YOU AGAIN ON OCTOBER\n\n***************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c18f57d0dc51dd56df1e74c08313ab015f543896","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+S01E22+HDTV+x264-LOL+FINALE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c18f57d0dc51dd56df1e74c08313ab015f543896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,143,87,208,220,81,221,86,223,30,116,192,131,19,171,1,95,84,56,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
