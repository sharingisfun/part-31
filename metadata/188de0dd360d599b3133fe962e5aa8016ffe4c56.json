Tom Brevoort was the editor of the title throughout its run. The critical and fan approval of the comic boosted Brevoort and Busiek&amp;#039;s career and by the time the series had finished both had achieved key positions on the bestselling Heroes Return titles Avengers and Iron Man. \n\nThis is a request from the demonoid forum. \n\nEnjoy and Seed.
