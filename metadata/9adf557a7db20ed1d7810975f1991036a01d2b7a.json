He posted a set of six .rar files containing sensitive information pertaining to deals between defence contractors and governments and the stability of the Middle East and many internal emails.  Subsequently, the files became very difficult to find because most of the filehosts stopped making them available.  After a great deal of effort, snooping around, trying links and research I finally found what I think is the original archive (after comparing its contents to news articles talking about the hack and the information inside).\n\nFiles contained within Britam.Defence.rar:\n\nBritam Defence/arch11.rar\nBritam Defence/arch1_locked.rar\nBritam Defence/arch22.rar\nBritam Defence/arch2_locked.rar\nBritam Defence/arch33.rar\nBritam Defence/arch3_locked.rar\nBritam Defence/Leaked Documents.txt\n\nStart looking in arch33.rar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9adf557a7db20ed1d7810975f1991036a01d2b7a","amp;dn":"Britam+Defence+leaked+information","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9adf557a7db20ed1d7810975f1991036a01d2b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,223,85,122,125,178,14,209,215,129,9,117,241,153,16,54,160,29,43,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
