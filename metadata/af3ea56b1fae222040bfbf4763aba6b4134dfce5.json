Computer Methods in Chemical Engineering presents the most commonly used simulation software, along with the theory involved. It covers chemical engineering thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, material and energy balances, mass transfer operations, reactor design, and computer applications in chemical engineering.\n\n\n\nThrough this book, students learn:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat chemical engineers do\n\nThe functions and theoretical background of basic chemical engineering unit operations\n\nHow to simulate chemical processes using software packages\n\nHow to size chemical process units manually and with software\n\nHow to fit experimental data\n\nHow to solve linear and nonlinear algebraic equations as well as ordinary differential equations\n\n\n\nAlong with exercises and references, each chapter contains a theoretical description of process units followed by numerous examples that are solved step by step via hand calculations and computer simulation using Hysys/Unisim, PRO/II, Aspen Plus, and SuperPro Designer. Adhering to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) criteria, the book gives students the tools needed to solve real problems involving thermodynamics and fluid-phase equilibria, fluid flow, material and energy balances, heat exchangers, reactor design, distillation, absorption, and liquidÃ¢â‚¬â€œliquid extraction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af3ea56b1fae222040bfbf4763aba6b4134dfce5","amp;dn":"Computer+Methods+in+Chemical+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af3ea56b1fae222040bfbf4763aba6b4134dfce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,62,165,107,31,174,34,32,64,191,191,71,99,171,166,180,19,77,252,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
