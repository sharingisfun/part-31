Readers will have material for hundreds of stimulating conversations and discussions. Better yet, they will have &quot;ammunition&quot; with which to counter the arguments of muscular apologists such as Gary Habermas, N.T. Wright, and William Lane Craig. Best of all, readers will be entertained by Professor Price's deconstruction of the Da Vinci Code-type books that have flooded the religious book market in recent years -- and provided the raw material for many a mirthful moment.\n\n279 pages\nPublisher: American Atheist Press (April 30, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1578840007\nISBN-13: 978-1578840007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:208a551b7b0b5cf62db9f61fe8501bfb6d871a37","amp;dn":"Jesus+is+Dead+%282007%29+by+Robert+McNair+Price","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"208a551b7b0b5cf62db9f61fe8501bfb6d871a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,138,85,27,123,11,92,246,45,185,246,31,232,80,27,251,109,135,26,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
