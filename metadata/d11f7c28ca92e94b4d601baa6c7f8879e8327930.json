It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. Typical uses include\n\n    * Math and computation\n    * Algorithm development\n    * Data acquisition\n    * Modeling, simulation, and prototyping\n    * Data analysis, exploration, and visualization\n    * Scientific and engineering graphics\n    * Application development, including graphical user interface building\n\nMATLAB is an interactive system whose basic data element is an array that does not require dimensioning. This allows you to solve many technical computing problems, especially those with matrix and vector formulations, in a fraction of the time it would take to write a program in a scalar noninteractive language such as C or Fortran.\n\nThe name MATLAB stands for matrix laboratory. MATLAB was originally written to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects. Today, MATLAB engines incorporate the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, embedding the state of the art in software for matrix computation.\n\nMATLAB has evolved over a period of years with input from many users. In university environments, it is the standard instructional tool for introductory and advanced courses in mathematics, engineering, and science. In industry, MATLAB is the tool of choice for high-productivity research, development, and analysis.\n\nMATLAB features a family of add-on application-specific solutions called toolboxes. Very important to most users of MATLAB, toolboxes allow you to learn and apply specialized technology. Toolboxes are comprehensive collections of MATLAB functions (M-files) that extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of problems. Areas in which toolboxes are available include signal processing, control systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic, wavelets, simulation, and many others.\n-------------------------------\n\nNice to see your comments here :-)\nCheers !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11f7c28ca92e94b4d601baa6c7f8879e8327930","amp;dn":"Matlab-R13-6.5-Full-ver.2.0-%28plus.serial.manual.documents.etc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11f7c28ca92e94b4d601baa6c7f8879e8327930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,31,124,40,202,146,233,75,77,96,27,170,108,127,136,121,232,50,121,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
