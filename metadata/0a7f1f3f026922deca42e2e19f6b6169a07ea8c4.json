Her own inherited blade, the Sword of the Lady, was both a burden and a danger to her father, Rudi Mackenzie, as it failed to save the king from being assassinated.\r\nBut the fabled sword lies deep within the Valley of Death, and the search will be far from easy. And war is building, in Montival and far beyond.\r\nAs Ã“rlaith and Reiko encounter danger and wonder, Ã“rlaith's mother, Queen Mathildha, believes her daughter's alliance and quest has endangered the entire realm. There are factions both within and without Montival whose loyalty died with the king, and whispers of treachery and war grow ever louder.\r\nAnd the Malevolence that underlies the enemy will bend all its forces to destroy them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7f1f3f026922deca42e2e19f6b6169a07ea8c4","amp;dn":"The+Desert+and+the+Blade%3A+A+Novel+of+the+Change+%5BEmberverse%2C+%2312","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7f1f3f026922deca42e2e19f6b6169a07ea8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,127,31,63,2,105,34,222,202,66,226,225,159,107,97,105,160,126,168,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
