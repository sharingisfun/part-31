The number-one New York Times-bestselling series returns\nwith a story as up-to-date as today's headlines.\n\nW.E.B. Griffin's novels featuring Delta Force officer Charley\nCastillo and his band of troubleshooters have won wide praise for\ntheir realism, action, and &quot;punchy prose that connects like a right\nhook&quot; (Chicago Tribune).\n\nNow, still in Argentina tying up loose ends from his investigation\ninto the UN oil-for-food scandal, Castillo is startled when a young\nman caught trying to sneak through the fence of his safe house\nturns out to be an American officer, a lieutenant assigned to the\nembassy in Paraguay. A DEA agent has disappeared while trying to\ninterdict drugs, and very little is being done about it, for\ndiplomatic reasons. The lieutenant has heard of Castillo, knows\nwhat he's done, and wants his help in getting the agent back.\n\nCastillo reluctantly agrees with the director of National\nIntelligence and the secretary of state that he is not qualified to\ntry to free the DEA agent, but this decision is overridden by the\npresident, who thinks Castillo can do just about anything, and who\nhas assured the mayor of ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who bounced the missing DEA agent\non his knee as a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that Castillo will get him back.\n\nFully aware that he's over his head dealing with the international\ndrug trade, Castillo nevertheless starts to comply with the\npresident's order, and quickly finds out that certain elements of\nthe intelligence and military communities who have been ordered to\ngive him whatever support he thinks he needs not only are not ready\nto help but seem to be willing to kill him and his men if that's\nwhat's necessary to keep him from exposing what they have been up\nto. And what have they been up to? He doesn't even want to think\nabout it....\n\nFilled with Griffin's trademark rich characters and cutting-edge\ndrama, this is an exceptional novel by &quot;a writer of true virtuosity\nand talent&quot; (Fort Worth Star-Telegram).\n\n----\n\nW.E.B. Griffin is also the author of the bestselling Corps,\nBrotherhood of War, Badge of Honor, Men at War, and Honor Bound\nseries. He has been invested into the orders of St. George of the\nU.S. Armor Association and St. Michael of the U.S. Army Aviation\nAssociation, and is a life member of the U.S. Special Operations\nAssociation; Gaston-Lee Post 5660, Veterans of Foreign Wars; China\nPost #1 in Exile of the American Legion; and the Police Chiefs\nAssociation of Southeast Pennsylvania, South New Jersey, and\nDelaware. He is an honorary life member of the U.S. Army Otter &amp;\nCaribou Association, the U.S. Army Special Forces Association, the\nU.S. Marine Corps Raider Association, and the USMC Correspondents\nAssociation.\n\n----\n\nDick Hill is the winner of three Audies and multiple AudioFile\nEarphones Awards.
