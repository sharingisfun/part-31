LaSalle's inexperience works against the film for some viewers, though Bresson himself was satisfied because his star proved himself a quick study in the art of lifting wallets (a genuine pickpocket was engaged as &quot;technical adviser&quot;). Essentially, the story is a character study of a cocky young criminal who becomes so entranced by the act of picking pockets that he literally can't stop himself. The Bressonian technique of concentrating more on the mechanics of the plot than the emotions of the characters is, as always, a matter of taste. Filmed in 1959, Pickpocket was released in the US in 1963. Loosely inspired by Feodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : pickpocket.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 2040 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 4.89 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 1844 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.249\n      StreamSize : 1004 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 104 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0053168\n\nFrench audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.\n\nCriterion Rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c368b8b7a0c9751737366fdca4cc7f110294b4","amp;dn":"pickpocket+%28bresson%2C+1959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c368b8b7a0c9751737366fdca4cc7f110294b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,195,104,184,183,160,201,117,23,55,54,111,220,164,204,127,17,2,148,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
