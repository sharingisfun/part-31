Each program began with the introduction: &quot;Before the war, Frank Race worked as an attorney, but he traded his law books for the cloak-and-dagger of the OSS. When the war was over, his former life was over too....adventure became his business!&quot;\n\nAlthough Race ran his investigative business out of a New York City office, he and his sidekick, Mark Donovan, were seldom there. Their pursuit of wrong-doers led them to ex-Nazi jewel robbers in Berlin and Monte Carlo, import thieves in Tunis, etc. Most of his assignments came from international insurance companies thus making the program something of a cross between more familiar contemporaries Dangerous Assignment and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar.\n\n\n\nSources: Thrillingdetective.com; On the Air, John Dunning; The 3rd Revised Ultimate History..., Jay Hickerson; Audio Classics.com (Salomonson)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOTRR Certification Information:\n\nSeries Name: The Adventures of Frank Race\nCertification Status: OTRR Certified Complete\nCertification Date: August 17, 2009\nCertification Version: Version 1\nNumber of CDs: 2\n\n\nFrom the Old Time Radio Researcher's Group.
