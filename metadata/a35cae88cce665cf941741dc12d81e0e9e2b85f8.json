This course demonstrates how to install both Java and the Eclipse IDE and dives into the particulars of programming. The course also explains the fundamentals of Java, from creating simple variables, assigning values, and declaring methods to working with strings, arrays, and subclasses; reading and writing to text files; and implementing object oriented programming concepts.\n*I included the exercise files :)*\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n\n\nWelcome 1m 3s \n\nIs this course for you? 5m 35s \nUsing the exercise files 3m 30s  \n1.
