Slaves to no single formula, the group draws from a well that runs as deep as the Beatles and Bowie, as accessible as R. Kelly and Michael Jackson and as heady as Ezra Pound and Steve Reich. The band signed to XL Recordings imprint Salvia in 2008 and released the single &quot;Suffragette, Suffragette&quot; in late November with plans for a full-length the following year.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82e7d630722f818015f2bc9bc4ee71f4e61f88cb","amp;dn":"Everything+Everything+-+Arc+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82e7d630722f818015f2bc9bc4ee71f4e61f88cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,231,214,48,114,47,129,128,21,242,188,155,196,238,113,244,230,31,136,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
