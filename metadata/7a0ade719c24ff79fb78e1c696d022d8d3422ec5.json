Timothy Leary's Last Trip follows Leary from his first days at West Point Military Academy to his final trip in cyber-space. Diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1995, Leary chose to exit this planet with all the energy of his countless excursions into the outer realms of the mind.  Joining Leary on his final trip are Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters (The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test), the legendary troupe of 60s counter-culture jesters, who reunite with the high priest of LSD for one last psychedelic blow-out at Wavy Gravy's &quot;Hog Farm Picnic&quot;. (This event took place two weeks after the death of Jerry Garcia, so the documentary contains a bit of a tribute to Jerry.)\nIncludes music by the Grateful Dead, featuring Turn On Your Love Light, I Know You Rider, Bertha, Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad, He's Gone, King Solomon's Mines, and Cold Rain and Snow.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164203/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164203/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n56 mins.\n708x480 2,247 Kbps AVC 29.97 fps\n385 Kbps 16 bits stereo AC3 (passthru from dvd)\n\n(Actually, of course, Timothy Leary's last trip was when his ashes were sent into space, along with those of Gene Roddenberry, eventually to burn up in the atmosphere as the container's orbit decayed.) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/1997/04/timothy-learys-last-trip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/1997/04/timothy-learys-last-trip&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a0ade719c24ff79fb78e1c696d022d8d3422ec5","amp;dn":"Timothy+Leary%27s+Last+Trip+-+1997+documentary+%5Bdvdrip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a0ade719c24ff79fb78e1c696d022d8d3422ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,10,222,113,156,36,255,121,251,120,225,198,150,208,34,216,211,66,46,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
