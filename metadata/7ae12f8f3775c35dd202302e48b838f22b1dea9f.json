Before the recent important changes they released their first demo in 2008 with five songs, that saw them hit the stage, within the region and in Athens, with local bands and not only.\n\nIn the beginning of 2009 the addition of a new a drummer (Dimitris), brought the spontaneous evolution of the band towards pure death metal. They instantly started writing new material with an appetite for more aggression. In 2010 they shared the stage with Rotting Christ, Mass Infection and other Greek bands in a festival that is organized each year in Livadia (Livadia Metal Fest).\n\nDuring the summer, they recorded the first, comprehensive demo of the current line up with a new name. This demo will be released soon under the title: Devastation Commence and will contain three songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae12f8f3775c35dd202302e48b838f22b1dea9f","amp;dn":"Eternal+Obscenity+-+Devastation+Commence+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae12f8f3775c35dd202302e48b838f22b1dea9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,225,47,143,55,117,195,93,210,2,48,46,72,184,56,242,43,29,234,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
