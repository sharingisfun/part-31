This is the GMS 1.2 beta which includes YoYoCompiler and shaders. This is a new auto-updater that i made that now downloads updates directly from steam servers. The change allows me to get new versions out quickly and more stabley. Do note that this is a experimental version and that there may be bugs, please let me know in the comments of any bugs so i can fix them up before i release a stable build. \n\n\n-VeryC-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8dda4ec9ccbd6ae015d008f3dc8174c33b05436","amp;dn":"GameMaker-Studio+1.1.1076+Auto-Update+Experimental","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8dda4ec9ccbd6ae015d008f3dc8174c33b05436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,221,164,236,156,203,214,174,1,93,0,143,61,200,23,76,51,176,84,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
