While the rest of Britain has devolved to anarchy, the M25 cordon protects a decaying city filled with homeless refugees, street gangs, exiled yakuza, crooked cops and mad cults. And something else; something new and dangerous.\nEnter Samuil Petrovitch: a Russian ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© with a smart mouth, a dodgy heart and a dodgier past. He's brilliant, friendless, cocky and - armed only with a genius-level intellect, prototype cyberware and a prodigious vocabulary of Russian swear words - might just be most unlikely champion a city has ever had.\nWelcome to the future. Mind the gap.\nThis omnibus edition contains EQUATIONS OF LIFE, THEORIES OF FLIGHT and DEGREES OF FREEDOM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76492bfd1b1244cbba7e2f7429f287b6c3ba2f42","amp;dn":"The+Petrovitch+Trilogy+%289272%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76492bfd1b1244cbba7e2f7429f287b6c3ba2f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,73,43,253,27,18,68,203,186,126,47,116,41,242,135,182,195,186,47,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
