On one hand we can access the experiments individually, once they are unlocked based on gold medals. On the other hand we can make a Decathlon competition with purely athletic tests. Finally, we participate in tournaments in different parts of the world with a series of tests and a scoring system similar to the decathlon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:854b285a6e953c7d6eb93746e1a66d38dff4591e","amp;dn":"International+Athletics+%5BMULTI2%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"854b285a6e953c7d6eb93746e1a66d38dff4591e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,75,40,90,110,149,60,125,110,185,55,70,225,166,109,56,223,244,89,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
