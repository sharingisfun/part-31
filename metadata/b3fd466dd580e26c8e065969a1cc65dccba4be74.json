In recent years, the band has been reconstituted at various points, and continues to perform occasionally.\n\nCrucial to their sound was their instrumentation; they were one of the few acts within the rock forum of the time to adopt the twin keyboard approach (both an organ and a piano player) alongside The Band (whose &quot;The Weight&quot; was recorded by Spooky Tooth as a single in 1968), Procol Harum, and Mott the Hoople.\n\nThey formed in October 1967, out of a combination of The Ramrods (1960 - late 1963), The V.I.P.'s (late 1963 - April 1967) and Art (April ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ October 1967). The line-up changed several times, but typically was -\n\nMike Harrison (born Michael Harrison, 3 September 1942, Carlisle, Cumberland) (keyboards/vocals) \nGreg Ridley (born Alfred Gregory Ridley, 23 October 1942, Aspatria, Cumbria ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ died 19 November 2003, in Java, Spain) (bass guitar/vocals) \nLuther (Luke) Grosvenor (born Luther James Grosvenor, 23 December 1946, Evesham, Worcestershire) (guitar/vocals) \nMike Kellie, (born Michael Alexander Kellie, 24 March 1947, Birmingham, Warwickshire) (drums) \nGary Wright, (born Gary Malcolm Wright, 26 April 1943, Cresskill, New Jersey, U.S.) (organ/vocals) \nIt was the latter's addition (after one album - see Discography) that signalled the name change from Art to Spooky Tooth. Gary Wright was introduced to the members of Art by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.[2]\n\n1969's Spooky Two LP is generally considered to be the best effort by the group and was the last album release by the original lineup. It included the song &quot;Better By You, Better Than Me&quot;, which was covered by Judas Priest on their 1978 release Stained Class. The track later gained some attention in the media as subject of a court trial in 1990. It was claimed that the subliminal messages in the song's recording by Judas Priest caused two youngsters to commit mutual suicide. The court finally judged in favor of the accused.\n\nRidley joined Humble Pie in 1969 and was replaced by Andy Leigh (in time for 1970's album Ceremony) who went on to Matthews Southern Comfort with ex-Fairport Convention vocalist Ian Matthews. The experimental nature of Ceremony received mixed reviews and following its release Wright also bowed out. The core of Harrison, Grosvenor and Kellie struggled on for one more album, aptly titled The Last Puff, completed with friends from Joe Cocker's Grease Band.\n\nThey broke up in the autumn of 1970, however after solo efforts Harrison and Wright reformed Spooky Tooth in September 1972 with a different (and frequently changing) line-up. The best known member of these line-ups (from March 1973 to September 1974) was Mick Jones (guitar / vocals), later in Foreigner and, from February ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ May 1974, Mike Patto (vocals) replaced Harrison for the 1974 release The Mirror\n\nAudio CD (February 4, 1991) \nOriginal Release Date: 1976 \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nFormat: Import \nLabel: Island UK \nASIN: B00000741P \n\n\nTrack Listings \n1.
