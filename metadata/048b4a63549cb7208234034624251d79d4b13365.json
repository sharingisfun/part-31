With love and reverence we worship Him, and in fear and longing we invoke His name. I testify that Muhammad is his servant, Prophet, His own beloved, best chosen and most trusted for His revelation, was sent down by Allah to save the human soul from self-indulgence and degradation, connecting it to the one who created the heavens and the earth. He was, by all means, a role model, and his message was a mercy and guidance for all mankind, giving them glad tidings and saving them from oppression. Peace and blessings be upon him.\n\n\nTitle: Rules on How to Interact with Non-Muslims\nLanguage: English\nPages:  64\nFormat: PDF\nAuthorship : Khalid b. Muhammad al-Maajid\nTranslation : Abdur-Rahman Murad\n\nShort Description: The author says in his introduction, Ã‚Â«The aim of this booklet is to educate new Muslims about laws that pertain to non-Muslims in matters of Aqeedah (creed) and Fiqh (Jurisprudential Law) and the stance one should acquire from them, and how he should interact with non-Muslims in his country, and other related issues. I have written this in response to the request of the brothers from Sulai DaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢wah Office in Riyadh who felt it was important to clarify these rulings to new Muslims in a concise and inclusive way.Ã‚Â»","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:048b4a63549cb7208234034624251d79d4b13365","amp;dn":"Rules+on+How+to+Interact+with+Non-Muslims","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"048b4a63549cb7208234034624251d79d4b13365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,139,74,99,84,156,183,32,130,52,3,70,36,37,29,121,212,177,51,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
