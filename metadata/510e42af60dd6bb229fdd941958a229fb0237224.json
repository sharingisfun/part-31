She knows more about zombies than anyone on the planet as she has been studying them for decades. So far the society has been successful in creating a web throughout the United States that has kept society safe from a major outbreak. The only thing they have failed at is creating a successful anti-serum for the zombie virus, and the danger of a major outbreak is steadily increasing as the worlds wealthiest take an interest in the undead. What could possibly go wrong? \n\nThis the authors first fiction story. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a creepy, nail biting- edge of your seat kind of book! Book one of the Zomboligist Series takes you first into the year 1886 on one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest to find a cure for his infected wife then sweeps you into modern times to a society on the verge of a major zombie outbreak. \nGenre: Dystopian, Horror, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:510e42af60dd6bb229fdd941958a229fb0237224","amp;dn":"Zombie+Hunters+by+Tj+Lynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"510e42af60dd6bb229fdd941958a229fb0237224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,14,66,175,96,221,107,178,41,253,217,65,149,138,34,159,176,35,114,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
