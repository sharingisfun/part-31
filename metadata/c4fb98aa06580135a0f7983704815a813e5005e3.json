Though not known at all as a Verve artist (only At Mister Kelly's), these tracks were mined from her dates in the '50s and '60s for Mercury/EmArcy and Roulette.  Of the 16 selections, there's a good mix of small-group sessions with such notables as trumpeter Clifford Brown and saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and big bands led by Quincy Jones or members of the Count Basie Orchestra.  Nary a string section is heard until the closer, &quot;Misty.&quot;  You get pure swing, not the sappy Sassy, during &quot;Cherokee,&quot; &quot;Shulie a Bop,&quot; &quot;Lullaby of Birdland,&quot; &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot; ( from the At Mister Kelly's date ), and &quot;Sassy's Blues,&quot; among others.  This is a very good compilation to find and keep. ~ Michael G. Nastos, All Music Guide \n\nThis is one of the first Sarah Vaughan CD's I came across. This lady was truly a great of her time. I fell in love with most of the songs here. My favorites being #5 How High the Moon? (improvised throughout), #2 September Song, #12 Say It Isn't So, #3 Shulie A Bop (written by her and her first husband George Treadwell), #15 Sassy's Blues, and #16 Misty (timeless and priceless).  The Ken Burns CD on her is just as great. ~ Thesavybamalady\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 18 - Sarah Vaughan \n01  Cherokee 2:32 \n02  September Song 5:46 \n03  Shulie A Bop 2:42 \n04  My Funny Valentine 3:00 \n05  How High The Moon 3:02 \n06  It ShouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Happen To A Dream 3:20 \n07  Linger Awhile 1:02 \n08  Poor Butterfly 3:34 \n09  Just One Of Those Things 2:33 \n10  Lonely Woman 3:03 \n11  Lullaby Of Birdland 4:01 \n12  Say It IsnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t So 5:25 \n13  Sometimes IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Happy 2:59 \n14  All The Things You Are 3:11 \n15  SassyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues 5:41 \n16  Misty 2:58 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4fb98aa06580135a0f7983704815a813e5005e3","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+18+-+Sarah+Vaughan+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4fb98aa06580135a0f7983704815a813e5005e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,251,152,170,6,88,1,53,160,247,152,55,4,129,90,129,62,80,5,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
