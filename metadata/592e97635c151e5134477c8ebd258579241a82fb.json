There it was right in front of him, flaws in the spectral content of the music and the means to immediately correct it. For almost a year and a half they communicated daily. Paavo, further tweaking the program so that it was more user friendly, and Earle, using it as part of his mastering chain, meanwhile giving feedback to Paavoand noticing how his clients were commenting positively on the newer fullness of their music.\n\nAugust 15th 2003, Har-Bal was launched and immediately created a buzz in the recording industry. Could this piece of software truly be that powerful? It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until Earle met Craig Anderton at the AES convention in New York that things really took off. Craig tested the software and two weeks later contacted the Har-Bal team and informed them that he is recommending Har-Bal for EQÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Magazine coveted Ã¢â‚¬Å“EQ Exceptional Quality AwardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe rest is historyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592e97635c151e5134477c8ebd258579241a82fb","amp;dn":"Har-Bal+v2.3-AMPLiFY-PatBat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592e97635c151e5134477c8ebd258579241a82fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,46,151,99,92,21,30,81,52,71,124,142,189,37,133,121,36,26,130,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
