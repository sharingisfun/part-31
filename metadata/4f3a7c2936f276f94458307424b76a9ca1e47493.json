Bigamy, unwanted pregnancy, possible incest and bothersome skin irritations are all part of their daily challenges, but the real &quot;star&quot; of the show is an enormous, dilapidated movie theater that doubles as family business and living space. At one time a prestige establishment, the theater now runs porn double bills and serves as a meeting ground for hustlers of every conceivable persuasion. The film captures the sordid, fetid atmosphere, interweaving various family subplots with the comings and goings of customers, thieves and even a runaway goat while enveloping the viewer in a maelstrom of sound, noise and continuous motion.\n\n\nLanguages: Philipine / Tagalog\n\nSubtitles srt: English / French / Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3a7c2936f276f94458307424b76a9ca1e47493","amp;dn":"Serbis+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3a7c2936f276f94458307424b76a9ca1e47493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,58,124,41,54,242,118,249,68,88,48,116,36,183,106,156,161,228,116,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
