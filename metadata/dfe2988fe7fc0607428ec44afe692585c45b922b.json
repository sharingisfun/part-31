He breaks a string during Over The Hills \r\nAnd Far Away and Plant seizes the idle time to chat up the crowd. Jonsey \r\nstarts in on keyboards to waste some time and Georgia On My Mind blossoms \r\nfrom the tinkering. This only lasts a few verses before Plant stops it \r\n&quot;The night club is now closed down and we can get on with the concert...&quot; \r\nand Jimmy's guitar has been fixed. For some reason Jimmy is clearly audible \r\nsinging the Whole Lotta Love choruses as never before or after!! The tape \r\nruns out shortly after The Bridge section of Whole Lotta Love and then ends \r\nsuddenly. Overall a good show but not their best from this tour and a very \r\nrare example when they dropped medley section out from this song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe2988fe7fc0607428ec44afe692585c45b922b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.05.26+Salt+Lake+City%2C+Utah+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe2988fe7fc0607428ec44afe692585c45b922b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,226,152,143,231,252,6,7,66,142,196,74,254,105,37,133,196,91,146,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
