And how brilliantly their disorder manifests on this their second album of screeching guitars and blasting drums.\n\nII is also perhaps the most niche and bemusingly twisted concept album you will come across this year. Based on the antics surrounding cult hero Ma Baker, her infamous sons (of disasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.see what they did there!?!?) and the killing spree that ensued as the law dodging family was caught and executed in a shoot out; if this record were a film, Tarantino would be all over it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1deb314211a1e3c430da40898926b3a4f8d376c","amp;dn":"Maylene+and+the+Sons+of+Disaster+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1deb314211a1e3c430da40898926b3a4f8d376c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,222,179,20,33,26,30,60,67,13,164,8,152,146,107,58,79,141,55,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
