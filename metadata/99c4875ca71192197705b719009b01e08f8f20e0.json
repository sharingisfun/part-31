Released as that album's first single, it peaked at #5 on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, giving Adkins his seventh Top Ten single on that chart.\n\nIn &quot;Hot Mama,&quot; the male narrator addresses his lover, telling her that he enjoys her body the way that it is.\n\nWilliam Ruhlmann of Allmusic gave the song a favorable review, saying that it &quot;has a frisky appeal and, with its erotically charged tag line, 'You wanna?' a novelty quality.\n\nComin' On Strong is the sixth album from American country music singer Trace Adkins. It was released on December 2, 2003 on Capitol Records Nashville. Although it produced only two singles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Hot Mama&quot; and &quot;Rough &amp; Ready&quot;, which respectively reached #5 and #13 on the Hot Country Songs charts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe track &quot;I'd Sure Hate to Break Down Here&quot; was later recorded by Julie Roberts as &quot;Break Down Here&quot; on her self-titled debut album.
