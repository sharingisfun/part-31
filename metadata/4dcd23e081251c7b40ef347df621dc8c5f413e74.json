In the previous torrent, issue 031 contained a broken archive and was missing a page. I've also updated it to include the newest issue of Green Lantern at the time of this posting, issue 041.\n\nIf you downloaded the previous torrent, all you need to download is the corrected version of issue 031 and issue 041 of Green Lantern. Everything else is entirely the same!\n---------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Green Lantern universe leading into The Blackest Night. As of 18 May 2009, it is up to date on both Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps.\n\nIncluded:\nGreen Lantern: Rebirth\nGreen Lantern Corps: Recharge\nGreen Lantern (2005) issue 001-041 (including Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns)\nGreen Lantern Corps (2006) issues 001-036\nBlackest Night #000\nTales of the Sinestro Corps\n\nThis includes the ENTIRE Sinestro Corps War in chronological order.\n\nAlso included are a few bonus stories.\n\nI did not scan these issues. I just compiled these files, put them into chronological order, REMOVED ALL THE ADVERTISEMENTS, and put it up for everyone.\n---------------------------------------------------\nWhen Blackest Night gets into full swing in July, I will be uploading monthly updates to this torrent, which will include both main title series (Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps), as well as the Blackest Night series and all related mini-series, one-shots, and crossovers.
