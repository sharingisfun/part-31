If you leave someone behind, chances are they will be pounced on and die. Move as a Squad and cover every corner.\n\nThree game modes: Campaign, Survival and Death Lab.&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought this game myself, and since I spend a ton of time here at PB downloading a lot of stuff and didn't see this here, I thought I would share it.  It's got a legit serial with it.  It doesn't connect to anything to update or check.\n\nJust Unzip/Unrar to a folder and and play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff180d1fd22ddc5cf02e8156f50769b98a06f0c0","amp;dn":"Survivor+Squad+1.05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff180d1fd22ddc5cf02e8156f50769b98a06f0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,24,13,31,210,45,220,92,240,46,129,86,245,7,105,185,138,6,240,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
