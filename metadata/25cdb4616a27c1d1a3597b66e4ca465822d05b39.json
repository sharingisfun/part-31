It re-introduced the character of Captain Marvel into the continuity of the Post-Crisis DC Universe and brought back some of his classic adversaries, including Black Adam and Doctor Sivana. Due to a second Post-Crisis reboot in the title Power of Shazam, this series is no longer considered part of the canonical DC continuity. \nEnjoy and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25cdb4616a27c1d1a3597b66e4ca465822d05b39","amp;dn":"Shazam%21+New+Beginning+1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25cdb4616a27c1d1a3597b66e4ca465822d05b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,205,180,97,106,39,193,209,163,89,123,102,228,202,70,88,34,208,91,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
