DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©anta is the Irish word for done  or made. The band were noted members of the traditional music scene in Ireland. They signed to Green Linnet and released three albums which blended traditional tunes and songs with arrangements sometimes veering towards a contemporary setting.\n\nThe former members played at the 8th Gig 'n The Bann Festival in September 2007. Their first performance after regrouping took place in October 2008 for BBC Two Northern Ireland's Blas Ceoil series.\n\nDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©anta (1993):\n\n1 \tThe Flight of the Termite \t 3:29\n2 \tThe Green Fields of Canada \t 4:39\n3 \tKing of the Blues \t\t 3:19\n4 \tCold Grey Fairyland \t\t 3:38\n5 \tWillie Taylor \t\t\t 3:56\n6 \tHarp Airs \t\t\t 5:26\n7 \tThousands Are Sailing \t\t 3:04\n8 \tGravelly Groove \t\t 3:13\n9 \tDark Iniseoghain \t\t 5:21\n\nReady for the Storm (1994):\n\n1 \tThe Mighty Clansmen \t\t 3:25\n2 \tThe Landsdowne Lass \t\t 4:09\n3 \tThe Lakes of Pontchartrain \t 5:02\n4 \tAn Raibh TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº Ag an gCarraig \t 2:43\n5 \tHammy's Jigs \t\t\t 3:08\n6 \tCulloden's Harvest \t\t 5:14\n7 \tLet the Hair Sit \t\t 3:47\n8 \tThe Maid That Sold Her Barley \t 2:42\n9 \tEleanor Plunkett \t\t 4:22\n10 \tThe Party \t\t\t 4:44\n11 \tReady for the Storm \t\t 3:39\n12 \tThe Rocky Reels \t\t 4:34\n13 \tThe Benedy Glen \t\t 5:51\n\nWhisper of a Secret (1997):\n\n1 \tTwo Days to Go \t\t\t 5:19\n2 \tWillie and Mary \t\t 4:08\n3 \tThe Usual Suspects \t\t 4:27\n4 \tPaddy and the Bandit \t\t 5:39\n5 \tLone Shanakyle \t\t\t 5:49\n6 \tWaltz of the White Lilies \t 5:42\n7 \tAt the Crossroads \t\t 4:14\n8 \tThe Blacksmith \t\t\t 3:09\n9 \tCogair Ruin \t\t\t 3:53\n10 \tThe Druid's Mountain \t\t 4:35\n11 \tWhere Are You \t\t\t 6:15\n12 \tScarta Glen Road \t\t 5:52\n\npersonnel:\n\n\tMary Dillon (vocals / Synth / Guitar / Harp)\n\tDeirdre Havlin (flute / whistles)\n\tRosie Mulholland (keyboard / fiddle)\n\tEoghan O'Brien (harp / guitar / Bells)\n\tKate O'Brien (fiddle / Viola / Guitar)\n\tClodagh Warnock (bouzouki / Fiddle / Bodhran / Percussion / Chimes).\n\n\tPaul Mullan (flute / whistles) on 1st album\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d20f1a886f8d25d176ea96ec0806a8ad0b60d1a","amp;dn":"D%C3%83%C2%A9anta+discography+3CD+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d20f1a886f8d25d176ea96ec0806a8ad0b60d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,32,241,168,134,248,210,93,23,110,169,110,192,128,106,138,208,182,13,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
