Ive actually paid\nclose to forty once to have the CD delivered to me at a hospital\nwhere I was staying for a brief period. I had previously borrowed it\nfor the local library where I first discovered it. \nIt currently going for $28 plus shipping on amazon dot com however.\nI spent many many hours listening to this CD back then and now I\nam only drawn to his style most on the Shamrocks and Heather CD\nwhere I believe he displays emotive brilliance commendable\nto the best of Irish singing from his quarter in the Canadian\nRegiment as it were.\n\nAnyways - its a brand new CD converted to 320k - two samples\nfrom the Shamrocks and Heather CD must have come from an old worn out\nCD I am sure, however that's how we previously found it on the net \nfor posting (never again at this shoddy level of CD workmanship\ndue to aging I promise) - soon we'll have the real McCoy for you\n- in the meantime I hope we have his cash register ringing for a\nbit more than a fiver so he can afford the haggis as it were as\nusual as it was back then eh!
