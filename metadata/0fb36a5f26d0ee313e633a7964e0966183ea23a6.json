Specifically, it's about a vision of processing power so distributed throughout the environment that computers per se effectively disappear. It's about the enormous consequences this disappearance has for the kinds of tasks computers are applied to, for the way we use them, and for what we understand them to be.\n\nAlthough aspects of this vision have been called a variety of names - ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, physical computing, tangible media, and so on - I think of each as a facet of one coherent paradigm of interaction that I call everyware.\n\nIn everyware, all the information we now look to our phones or Web browsers to provide becomes accessible from just about anywhere, at any time, and is delivered in a manner appropriate to our location and context. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.studies-observations.com/everyware/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.studies-observations.com/everyware/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote: If you have trouble opening the file, please read this:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/902225/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/902225/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fb36a5f26d0ee313e633a7964e0966183ea23a6","amp;dn":"Everyware%3A+The+Dawning+Age+of+Ubiquitous+Computing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fb36a5f26d0ee313e633a7964e0966183ea23a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,179,106,95,38,208,238,49,62,99,58,121,100,224,150,97,131,234,35,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
