After hearing the band for the first time Gggarth decided that what the UNION was doing was so different from what he was used to that he signed on to produce The WASHBOARD UNION's album on the spot. Recorded at THE FARM studio in Gibson B.C. it would become Gggarth's first country album and the debut album for THE WASHBOARD UNION. Gggarth then reached out to Bob Ezrin who produced the song &quot;Half Cree&quot; for the new album as well. With 4 distinct voices, The Washboard Union is a songwriting collective with one of the most captivating live shows on the road today.\n\nVBR-MP3 Full Album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64f1ba2784a1202cd7f2279416e1698c6e6a58b","amp;dn":"The+Washboard+Union","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64f1ba2784a1202cd7f2279416e1698c6e6a58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,79,27,162,120,74,18,2,205,127,34,121,65,110,22,152,198,230,165,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
