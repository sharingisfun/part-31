Everytime I listen to &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;A Place For Me&quot; I am 23 again. So nostalgic. This is their ultra rare &quot;The Best of CD&quot; released in 1991 in limited numbers. I was lucky to pick up a copy in Paris the same year.  \n\nComateens:\n\nProfile: The Comateens were formed in New York in 1980 by Ramona Jan (guitar), Nik North (bass, vocals), and a drum machine. After Lyn Byrd (synthesizer, vocals) and Oliver North (guitar, vocals) joined the group, they recorded their self-titled debut LP in 1981. The album became a cult favorite among college hipsters, especially the band's remake of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Munsters Theme&quot;. However, the Comateens actually gained a larger following in Europe, wherein the group's quirks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ such as the necrophilia tale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCool Chick&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ were more easily digested. The band released two more LPs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1983's Pictures on a String and 1984's Deal With It ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and then split up in 1985. Byrd and Oliver North eventually reunited in North and Byrd, but North passed away soon thereafter. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n1   Late Nite City (3:00) \n2   Ghosts (3:56) \n3   Nightmare (2:56) \n4   One By One (4:12) \n5   Get Off My Case (3:22) \n6   Cold Eyes (4:44) \n7   The Late Mistake (2:29) \n8   Uptown (2:45) \n9   Don't Come Back (3:30) \n10   Resist Her (3:45) \n11   Love Will Follow You (3:00) \n12   She's An Angel (2:50) \n13   Stay With Me (3:58) \n14   Winter (3:03) \n15   Don't Give Me Up (3:57) \n16   A Place For Me (3:15) \n     \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9799a95b45125e573129a690107c6a713bdef35","amp;dn":"Comateens+-+One+By+One+-+The+Best+of+Comateens+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9799a95b45125e573129a690107c6a713bdef35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,121,154,149,180,81,37,229,115,18,154,105,1,7,198,167,19,189,239,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
