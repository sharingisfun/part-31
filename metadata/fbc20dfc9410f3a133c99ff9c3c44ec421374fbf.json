It's a trap: when a ship-load from France arrives in Odessa, only a physician and his family are spared execution or prison. He and his French wife (her passport ripped up) are sent to Kiev. She wants to return to France immediately; he knows that they are captives and must watch every step. By chance, she meets a touring French actress and pleads for help. She also takes a young swimmer under her wing, and several years later, he makes a bold attempt to escape. Meanwhile, the KGB is suspicious, and hope for freedom is dim. Patience, her husband's self control, and her good looks may be their only assets.\nA powerful portrayal of love, heroism and tyranny, Est-Ouest makes a striking contrast to RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gis Wargnier previous epic film, Indochine . With its bold, epic feel, relentlessly leaden cinematography and convincing performances, Est-Ouest is a compelling work made with great skill, confidence and humanity.\n\nAudio: French and Russian\nSubtitles: English, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc20dfc9410f3a133c99ff9c3c44ec421374fbf","amp;dn":"Regis+Wargnier+-+Est+-+Ouest+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc20dfc9410f3a133c99ff9c3c44ec421374fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,194,13,252,148,16,243,161,51,201,159,249,195,196,78,196,33,55,79,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
