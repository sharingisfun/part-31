It is set in the fictional village of Emmerdale (known as Beckindale until 1994) in West Yorkshire, England, and was created by Kevin Laffan, with Steve Frost and Gavin Blyth serving as Executive Producer and Series Producer respectively since 2009.\n\nEmmerdale is the third most popular soap opera on British television, behind Coronation Street and EastEnders.\n\nThe series is produced by Yorkshire Television and broadcast on the ITV network, and was first aired on 16 October 1972. It was originally conceived and broadcast as a daytime programme in an afternoon slot, becoming an early evening programme in 1978 in most ITV regions - but excluding London and Anglia, both of which followed in the mid-1980s. Until the mid-1980s, Emmerdale took seasonal breaks and was not an all year round soap. The series was first broadcast over the Christmas holiday period in 1988.\n\n\nI have the first 116 episodes as DVDRips from the Network releases then up to 244 (missing the last 2 episodes from March 1975) as VHSRips. 1 Episode from 1976 none from '77 and then good chunks of '78-'79. I'm still organizing all my Emmerdales. Just know this is the first of many month packs to be upload.\n\nI wish I thank ALL of the cappers from TheBox.bz who shared these wonderful classic episodes. I have changed folder and files names for better organization and to protect those wonderful cappers. \n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdf30ac588bb8a9f6fc5ed2d866d1adc182758e","amp;dn":"Emmerdale+-+Episodes+00001-00006+October+1972+%28DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cdf30ac588bb8a9f6fc5ed2d866d1adc182758e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,223,48,172,88,139,184,169,246,252,94,210,216,102,209,173,193,130,117,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
