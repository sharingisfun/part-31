Beginning at New York Seagram Plaza, one of the most used open areas in the city, the film proceeds to analyze why this space is so popular and then looks at how a number of other urban oases, both in New York and elsewhere, measure up.  Narrated by author and Urban advocate William H. Whyte and based on direct observation of what people actually do, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces presents a remarkably engaging and informative tour of the urban landscape, while exploring how it can be made more hospitable for those who must live in it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60fa842a62b93263d56350fc7601afc25f945e11","amp;dn":"Social+Life+of+Small+Urban+Places.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60fa842a62b93263d56350fc7601afc25f945e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,250,132,42,98,185,50,99,213,99,80,252,118,1,175,194,95,148,94,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
