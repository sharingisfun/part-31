Great, now the GOP can be known as the champions of worthless healthcare plans! These are not healthcare plans. If you get injured, these are just insults that can be added to the injuryÃ¢â‚¬â€insults that you pay for.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Tom Pascrell pushed back against GOP hypocrisy over Obamacare at a Congressional hearing. If Obamacare has a flat, Republicans donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to change the tire. They want to push the whole car into the ditch and leave it there.\n\nGreta van Susteren at Fox News interviewed the woman with the $54 insurance plan from the CBS News story, and did a better job journalistically than CBS did. Of course, you could do better than CBS did by asking the woman virtually any question. Unlike CBS, Van Susteren actually asked the woman about hospitalization coverage. The woman said Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a little confused about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sweetie, if you think you get anything in the way of hospitalization, then you are not confused. You are just plain wrong.\n\nThe policy the woman had was incredibly and intentionally confusing. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blame her for not being able to understand it. You can, however, blame CBS News for not being able to understand it. CBS was out-reported by FoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Greta Van Susteren. How bad does your reporting have to be when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse than the reporting on a channel that intentionally tries to misrepresent the stories? Greta at Fox got closer to the truth here than CBSÃ¢â‚¬â€and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the job of everybody at Fox News to stay as far away from the truth as possible.\n\nFox News actually did something right. But donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worryÃ¢â‚¬â€they corrected it immediately. Or should I say that they Ã¢â‚¬Å“incorrectedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ it? Shortly after her talk with Greta Van Susteren, Dianne Barrett was told that all of her upcoming scheduled appearances on Fox News were cancelled. Sorry, Dianne, but once the truth about your situation came out, you were no longer of any use to Fox News.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443e737e624d40f11717ce5325188f4e6fe18c98","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+30+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443e737e624d40f11717ce5325188f4e6fe18c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,62,115,126,98,77,64,241,23,23,206,83,37,24,143,78,111,225,140,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
