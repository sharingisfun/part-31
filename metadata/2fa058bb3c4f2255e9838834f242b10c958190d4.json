Swarns is nothing less than a breathtaking and expansive portrait of America itself.\n\nIn this extraordinary feat of genealogical researchÃ¢â‚¬â€in the tradition of The Hemmingses of Monticello and Slaves in the FamilyÃ¢â‚¬â€author Swarns, a respected Washington-based reporter for the New York Times, tells the fascinating and hitherto untold story of Ms. ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s black, white, and multiracial ancestors; a history that the First Lady herself did not know.\n\nAt once epic, provocative, and inspiring, American Tapestry is more than a true family saga; it is an illuminating mirror in which we may all see ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nMichelle Obama's family saga is a remarkable, quintessentially American storyÃ¢â‚¬â€a journey from slavery to the White House in five generations. In this prodigiously researched epic, New York Times correspondent Rachel L. Swarns traces that complex and fascinating taleÃ¢â‚¬â€from the men who fought in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, to the mothers and fathers who endured the horrors of slavery and the indignities of segregation to build a better future for their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€uncovering details about Mrs. Obama's black, white, and multiracial forebears that even the First Lady herself did not know.\n\nThough an intimate family history, American Tapestry is also the collective chronicle of our changing nation, a beautifully rendered and singularly inspiring story with resonance for us all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublisher Amistad; 1st Edition, 1st Pri edition (January 1, 1112)\n\nASIN \tB00BXU8M4W\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Tapestry-Multiracial-Ancestors-Michelle/dp/0061999873&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Tapestry-Multiracial-Ancestors-Michelle/dp/0061999873&lt;/a&gt; (second edition -  above text is sourced from second edition) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Tapestry-Multiracial-Ancestors-Michelle/dp/B00BXU8M4W/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373163323&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=american+tapestry+michelle+obama&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Tapestry-Multiracial-Ancestors-Michelle/dp/B00BXU8M4W/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373163323&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=american+tapestry+michelle+obama&lt;/a&gt; (first edition)\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: barack, obama, barry, black, biracial, IR, multiracial, preseident, bush, war, afghanistan, 2008, change, yes, we, can, hope, biden, china, afghanistan, tea, party, republican, democrat, politics, michele, white, obama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa058bb3c4f2255e9838834f242b10c958190d4","amp;dn":"American+Tapestry%3A+The+Story+of+the+Black%2C+White%2C+and+Multiracia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa058bb3c4f2255e9838834f242b10c958190d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,160,88,187,60,79,34,85,233,131,136,52,242,66,177,12,149,129,144,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
