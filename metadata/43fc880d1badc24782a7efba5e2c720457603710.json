Building on an intuitive user interface, GIF\n              Movie Gear adds powerful tools to help you get your animations\n              in gear. This is a professional level tool for the professional\n              Web designer.\n\n              Easy-to-use intuitive interface that lets you see all the frames\n              at once and to use the mouse to interactdirectly with the frames.\n\n              Multiple selection of frames for easy manipulation of more than one\n              frame at a time. And because of the superior interface, you can see\n              which frames you have selected.\n\n              Control of all aspects of animation from delays to removal methods\n              to palette management directly from the toolbar (screen shot).\n\n              Edit Timing quickly and easily directly in the preview window,\n              either frame by frame or using relative or absolute global changes\n              (screen shot).\n\n              LiveEdit lets you edit a frame or the whole animation (as layers in\n              Photoshop) directly in the image editor of your choice. Changes\n              saved in the editor appear automatically in GMG.\n\n              24-Bit Color support to let you build animations (AVI) without\n              losing any color data. Also useful for icon files and for PSD, PNG,\n              BMP, and JPEG manipulation.\n\n              Palette reduction with a before-and-after animated view to help get\n              your file size down while maintaining the animations image quality.\n\n              Inter-frame optimization to shrink the file size even more.\n\n              Blend Two Animations frame by frame to easily generate a composite\n              animation. It&amp;#039;s never been easier to put two animations side by\n              side or a new background behind a sprite animation.\n\n              blah, blah, blah...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43fc880d1badc24782a7efba5e2c720457603710","amp;dn":"Gamani.GIF.Movie.Gear.v4.2.Incl.Keygen-ONY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43fc880d1badc24782a7efba5e2c720457603710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,252,136,13,27,173,194,71,130,167,239,186,94,44,114,4,87,96,55,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
