We go through some of the ways people smoke their pot, talk about Amanda Bynes briefly, and hear about the utter bullshit that going on with Artie Lange. Ant reminisces about his Uncle Joe, talks about the upcoming poker tournament at Mohegan Sun, and Mike Bocchetti joins Anthony in studio. Mike and Ant talk about his training and weight loss, his dream of building a castle in France (WTF?), and they share stories about young family life and how things have changed. They also talk about famous encounters that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had, how knowing a little about a lot of things is important, we find out why camera crews are currently following Mike around, they take a few calls, and end the show with a Happy Days clip.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed! \n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44405ae5d03ef2e1c2867fec5eb90424ce5b5b9e","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-05+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44405ae5d03ef2e1c2867fec5eb90424ce5b5b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,64,90,229,208,62,242,225,194,134,127,236,94,185,4,36,206,91,91,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
