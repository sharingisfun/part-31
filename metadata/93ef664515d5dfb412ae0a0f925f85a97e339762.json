While the benefits of ion implantation are well recognized for many commercial endeavors, there have been recent developments in this field. Improvements in equipment, understanding of beam-solid interactions, applications to new materials, improved characterization techniques, and more recent developments to use implantation for nanostructure formation point to new directions for ion implantation and are presented in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ef664515d5dfb412ae0a0f925f85a97e339762","amp;dn":"Ion+Implantation+-+Mark+Goorsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ef664515d5dfb412ae0a0f925f85a97e339762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,239,102,69,21,213,223,180,18,174,10,15,146,95,133,169,126,51,151,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
