Boudreaux\nDrawing upon the thinking and analyses of renowned intellectuals, this documentary sketches a portrait of neo-liberal ideology and examines the various mechanisms used to impose its dictates throughout the world.\nNeo-liberalismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one-size-fits-all dogmas are well known: deregulation, reducing the role of the State, privatization, limiting inflation rather than unemployment, etc. In other words, depoliticizing the economy and putting it into the hands of the financial class. And these dogmas are gradually settling into our consciousness because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re being broadcast across a vast and pervasive network of propaganda.\n\nIn fact, beginning with the founding in 1947 of the Mont PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨lerin Society, neo-liberal think tanks financed by multinational companies and big money have propagated neo-liberal ideas in universities, in the media, and in governments.\n\nThis ideology, convinced of its historical and scientific validity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as proven, in particular, by the fall of the Soviet Union ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ has intoxicated all governments, left and right alike. In fact, since the end of the Cold War, the rate of neo-liberal reforms has increased dramatically. Often imposed with force, either through the structural adjustment plans of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, under the pressure of financial markets and multinationals, or even by outright war, the neo-liberal doctrine has now reached every corner of the planet.\n\nBut behind the ideological smokescreen, behind the neat concepts of natural order and the harmony of interests in a free market, beyond the panacea of the \\&quot;invisible hand,\\&quot; what is really going on?\n\n\nAudio: native french and english\nSubtitles: french, english, spanish, german, portugese\n\nProduction Notes\nTotal Running Time: 2:33:29\nScreening Format: Video 4:3\nDates of Production: 2008\nCountry of Origin: Canada\n\nFormat: Avi\nCodec: XVID\nResolution: 704 x 512\nFrame Rate: 25 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a293709b9c38582c2d1890117ef5a5efb396680","amp;dn":"L%5C%27Encerclement+%282008%29+Richard+Brouillette","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a293709b9c38582c2d1890117ef5a5efb396680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,41,55,9,185,195,133,130,194,209,137,1,23,239,90,94,251,57,102,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
