Mods plays these grooves in repeat mode, to let the echoes resonate, echoes of the eternal adolescent refrain: rage, frustration, fear.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Serge BozonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s succinct description of his film is spot on. Like a diamond stylus in contact with a vinyl record groove his characters spin round and round, prisoners of the campus walls. Edouard, a student and inveterate seducer there, is ill. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrong with him? Worried, the school headmistress, looking like a 19th century English governess in her Peter Pan collar, writes to his two inseparable brothers. They come to the campus, disturbed at being pulled out of their own world, and are equally disturbing for the students, ersatz mods casually leaning against the wall, in a pose which recalls those 60sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ single covers. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are soldiersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our jobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the brothers keep repeating like a broken record. The 60s are very present in this atemporal film. First, in the title, which refers to the Ã‚Â«modÃ‚Â» movement of young working-class teens in the 60s, fans of the Who and the Kinks: as portrayed in Franc RoddamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quadrophenia (1979), one of the best cinematic reflections of that era. Rather than use the English music of that time, which Serge Bozon thought made it too datable, he preferred American garage-punk, of which he is an avid collector, and which he uses in the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five unexpected and stylised choreographed numbers. Second, Bozon readily admits the nods to Nouvelle Vague auteurs: Godard (the way the dialogue is performed), Truffaut (the chief medical officer looks like Jean-Pierre LÃƒÂ©aud), Rivette (the unfathomable plot), Rohmer (the relationships and love intrigues). And this mysterious illness of EdouardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s? Love, revealed to him by a young girl, which might conclude, as in France GallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words: Ã¢â‚¬Å“But one day I want to live my songs without fear of boysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Film Festival Locarno\n\nEnglish subs included.\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 808 MiB\nDuration                                 : 56mn 34s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 997 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                          : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 56mn 34s\nBit rate                                 : 1 795 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.667\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.292\nStream size                              : 726 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 56mn 33s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 77.7 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc5e6ee1ed50cbff00afe95f5afb773325f478d","amp;dn":"Mods+%28Serge+Bozon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc5e6ee1ed50cbff00afe95f5afb773325f478d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,197,230,238,30,213,12,191,240,10,254,149,245,175,183,115,50,95,71,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
