They released two records on ZTT, &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; and &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;. (Both re-released with bonus tracks.)\n\nShe now works with Paul Humphreys from OMD, and their band is called OneTwo. Here Claudia explains why they put on this concert:\n\n&quot;Over the years weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve extended our live band. This happened in conjunction with the release of Combined, a best of me compilation, which is where I could in a way finally settle down and look at my overall history of song from when I started in the early 80s to nearly thirty years later, from Propaganda to Onetwo.\n\nTo celebrate this release we decided to give a one off performance in London at the Scala in KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cross, with some special guests who were part of my musical career. My guests were Susanne Freytag &amp; Ralf DÃƒÂ¶rper, Glenn Gregory &amp; Martyn Ware (Heaven 17), Andy Bell and Andrew Poppy.&quot;\n\nThis concert is also available as a 7gb ISO, but you don't need to download that, since the quality of this x264 rip is flawless.\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.claudiabrucken.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.claudiabrucken.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cagJnaaEB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cagJnaaEB&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContents:\n1) Concert (1h37m37s)\n2) Backstage (photos by Glenn Gregory) (7m55s)\n3) Thank You (music video) (4m28s)\n\n\nSpecifications:\n---\nCodec: h264\nResultion: 720x576\nAverage bitrate: 2000 kbps (2-pass encoding, slow 1st pass)\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 (direct from DVD)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5024fd08f8d625d560e63cf8b8889936ce3fdbde","amp;dn":"Claudia+Br%26uuml%3Bcken+-+This+Happened%3A+Live+At+The+Scala+%28DVDRiP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5024fd08f8d625d560e63cf8b8889936ce3fdbde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,36,253,8,248,214,37,213,96,230,60,248,184,136,153,54,206,63,219,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
