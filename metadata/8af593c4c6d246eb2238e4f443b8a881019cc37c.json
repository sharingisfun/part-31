His instinct for striking the deepest chords of fear in our hearts and minds is unerring, and his gift for steering a tale from the light of day into the darkest depths of nightmare is at its harrowing best in House of Reckoning. \n\nAfter the untimely death of her mother, fourteen-year-old Sarah Crane is forced to grow up quickly in order to help tend her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vermont farm and look after her grieving father, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drowning his sorrow in alcohol. But their quiet life together is shattered when her father is jailed for killing another man in a barroom brawl and injuring Sarah in a drunken car crash. Left in the cold care of a loveless foster family and alienated at school, Sarah finds a kindred spirit in classmate Nick Dunnigan, a former mental patient still plagued by voices and visions. And in eccentric art instructor Bettina Phillips, Sarah finds a mentor eager to nurture her talent for painting. \n\nBut within the walls of BettinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancestral home, the mansion called Shutters, Sarah finds something altogether different and disturbing. Monstrous images from the houseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark history seem to flow unbidden from SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paintbrushÃ¢â‚¬â€œimages echoed by NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chilling hallucinations. Trapped for ages in the shadowy rooms of Shutters, the violence and fury of long-dead generations have finally found a gateway from the grave into the world of the living. And Sarah and Nick have found a power they never had: to take control, and take revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af593c4c6d246eb2238e4f443b8a881019cc37c","amp;dn":"House+Of+Reckoning+%28Horror+Audiobook%29+-+By+John+Saul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af593c4c6d246eb2238e4f443b8a881019cc37c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,245,147,196,198,210,70,235,34,56,228,244,67,184,168,129,1,156,195,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
