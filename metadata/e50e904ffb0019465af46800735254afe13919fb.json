The first edition, the original Ã¢â‚¬Å“Foley and van Dam,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ helped to define computer graphics and how it could be taught. The second edition became an even more comprehensive resource for practitioners and students alike. This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications.\n\n \n\nThe authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphicsÃ¢â‚¬â€œknowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, programÃ‚Â­ming problems, and hands-on projects.\n\n \n\nThis revised edition features:\n\n- New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering\n- An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering\n- Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces\n- 3D real-time graphics platformsÃ¢â‚¬â€œtheir design goals and trade-offsÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding new mobile and browser platforms\n- Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development \n\nThe text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book. Programs are written in C++, C#, WPF, or pseudocodeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwhichever language is most effective for a given example. Source code and figures from the book, testbed programs, and additional content will be available from the authors' website (cgpp.net) or the publisher's website  (informit.com/title/9780321399526). Instructor resources will be available from the publisher. The wealth of information in this book makes it the essential resource for anyone working in or studying any aspect of computer graphics.\n\n\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\nJohn F. Hughes is a Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. His primary research is in computer graphics, particularly those aspects of graphics involving substantial mathematics.\n\nAndries van Dam is the Thomas J. Watson, Jr. University Professor of Technology and Education, and Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. AndyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research includes work on computer graphics, hypermedia systems, post-WIMP user interfaces, including immersive virtual reality and pen- and touch-computing, and educational software.\n\nMorgan McGuire is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Williams College.
