A 'Yes' vote in the referendum on Scottish independence would see the break-up of the 300-year-old union, adding a constitutional crisis to a deep economic crisis. An accessible polemic written for progressives both north and south of the border, Yes argues that independence can reinvigorate campaigns against austerity across Britain and deal a blow to the imperialist ambitions of the British state. An urgent and invigorating political intervention, Yes argues that even if the referendum result is 'no', a progressive independence campaign will alter the political landscape. Written by leading activists from the Radical Independence Campaign, Yes will be a unique contribution to the referendum debate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c8926b90691e0df646f3fd6f069139f898dab2","amp;dn":"Yes+-+The+Radical+Case+for+Scottish+Independence+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c8926b90691e0df646f3fd6f069139f898dab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,200,146,107,144,105,30,13,246,70,243,253,111,6,145,57,248,152,218,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
