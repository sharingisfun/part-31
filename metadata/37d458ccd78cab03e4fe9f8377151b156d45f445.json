WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s complicated is what we do with money. We use money to soothe our feelings and buy respect, to show how much we care or how little. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t simply earn, save, and spend money: we flirt with it, crave it, and scorn it; we punish and reward ourselves with it.\n\nWithout realizing it, we give money meaning it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really haveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what former psychiatrist and current business coach David Krueger calls our ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmoney story.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ And in the process of playing out that money story, we often sacrifice the most important things in our life: our health, freedom, relationships, and happiness.\n\nThe Secret Language of Money is a guided tour to the subconscious meanings we give money, the conflicted ways our braindeals with money, the reasons we tend to make the same money mistakes over and overÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and most importantly, how you can change all that.\n\nA brilliant blend of cutting-edge science and real-world application, The Secret Language of Money helps you rewrite your money story and find that elusive balance of wealth, health, and joy we all seek.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d458ccd78cab03e4fe9f8377151b156d45f445","amp;dn":"McGraw+Hill+-+The+Secret+Language+of+Money.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d458ccd78cab03e4fe9f8377151b156d45f445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,212,88,204,215,140,171,3,228,254,159,131,119,21,27,21,109,69,244,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
