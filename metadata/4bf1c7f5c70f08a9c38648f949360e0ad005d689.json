She made fixed versions of both issues, so here are the new ones, please replace your old version :)\n\n\nThe Gentleman Who Did Not Like Guns 1 - Chili Con Carnage\nWhat could possess Master Byron Peck, roguish lawyer of the Los Angeles bar, to abandon his biotope to bake in the Arizona desert? And who is Knut Hoggaard, the imposing Dane who accompanies him and speaks only in vague, guttural mumbles? Neither individual is there by chance and neither is Margot de Garine, a Franco-Russian aristocrat who travels alone and seemingly attracts train-attacks... Come to think of it, thats a lot of new arrivals to a region with a population density that usually verges on zero! It would be no surprise if this story proved to be explosive!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/HW96jnWL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/HW96jnWL.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/z66pmfmf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/z66pmfmf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/uXz64T7d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/uXz64T7d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/AgAJdvK6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/AgAJdvK6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Gentleman Who Did Not Like Guns 2 - On The Madison Trail\nWhen one has twice escaped certain death, prudence suggests backing off. But Byron Peck is very eager to become a widower and lay hands on those famous letters his wife stole. The indestructible Mister Hoggaard, rightful owner of the documents and said ladys ex-lover shares the same mindset: no rest for the weary until Margot has paid for her crimes. But the lady may not yet have reached the fullest extent of her treachery and the next victim could very well be the mysterious Indian who surprised them all by stealing the Mexicans treasure.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/sBORk1YW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/sBORk1YW.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/JknYr1Ml.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/JknYr1Ml.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/3kMqQrTX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/3kMqQrTX.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/J6w0ilrj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/J6w0ilrj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf1c7f5c70f08a9c38648f949360e0ad005d689","amp;dn":"The+Gentleman+Who+Did+Not+Like+Guns+1-2+%28fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf1c7f5c70f08a9c38648f949360e0ad005d689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,241,199,245,199,15,8,169,195,134,72,249,73,54,14,10,208,5,214,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
