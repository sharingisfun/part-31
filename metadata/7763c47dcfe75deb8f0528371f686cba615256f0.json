Recorded for the most part in pubs and country cottages over the last fifteen years by collectors whose names read like a roll of honourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Peter Kennedy, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©amus Ennis, Alan Lomax, Sean O'Boyle, Hamish HendersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½annotated by Lomax, Kennedy and Shirley Collins, edited by A.L. Lloyd, and accompanied by a booklet with the words of each song, notes, references, etcÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this is the kind of enterprise (you might think) that only Topic would undertake. In fact it is a reissue of a series brought out seven years ago by the American Caedmon label in New York. Many of the singers representedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like Jeannie Robertson, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©amus Ennis, Jimmy MacBeath, Davie Stewart, Bob and Ron Copper are already well known to those who take their folk song seriously. Tracks I particularly liked were Bogie's Bonnie Belle, sung by Davie Stewart of Dundee, The False Young Man by Frank and Francis McPeake and Shale Aroon by Elizabeth Croonin of Cork. Do not be misled by the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBritishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Irish Republic is strongly represented on this record, too, in both Gaelic and English. This is obviously (as they say) destined to become a standard work of reference. I enjoyed it not only for the beauty and interest of the songs themselves, but for more nostalgic reasons. It took me back to those old pre-Dylan days when folk was folk, and pop was pop, and nobody really imagined that the two would ever meet the way they did. The extraordinary thing is that a new, post-Dylan generation of singersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or one wing of it, at any rateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is now beginning to rediscover the kind of folk songs we sang or listened to ten years ago at Cecil Sharp House.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7763c47dcfe75deb8f0528371f686cba615256f0","amp;dn":"The+Folk+Songs+of+Britain+Vol+1+%28Songs+of+Courtship%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7763c47dcfe75deb8f0528371f686cba615256f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,99,196,125,207,231,93,235,143,5,40,55,31,104,108,186,97,82,86,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
