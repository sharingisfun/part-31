The review below sums it up nicely.  There's a place in my brain that contains this artist, his words and his sounds.  It woke up today after finding this CD in a thrift store.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n\n[quote]By Kelly Hahn\nI am deeply disappointed that we in the States did not do justice to The Lightning Seeds. We fork out millions for unimaginative techno, yet let the beauty of Ian Broudie go unheeded. It's our loss.\nCloudcuckooland came out when I was a non-descript freshman in high school. He became my hero. I mean, look at him. He's not exactly Ricky Martin. Yet he wrote about wistful, unrealized longings that spoke to me as I tried to craft an identity among 1,500 other equally confused souls.\n&quot;Pure&quot; was antithetical to the &quot;I'm Gonna Sex You Up&quot; mentality of the day. I think purity is a decent word to define the message of The Lightning Seeds (which is also why he was probably ignored). &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and &quot;The Nearly Man&quot; were just a few of the many brilliant songs he composed.\nOkay, &quot;Frenzy&quot; was a stinker, but hey! It's the only one. It's hard to think about my youth without calling to mind sitting in my bedroom on a cold December night, listening to the encouragement of Ian Broudie--urging me to find the purity in someone, and not to take it away. If you ever battled loneliness as a youth--or even now--you may find your spirits lifted by Cloudcuckooland.\n[/quote]\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/227b07b70e3b670056903568bda70b1358cd3aff.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Lightning Seeds, The - Cloudcuckooland (MCAD-6404)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Lightning Seeds, The\nAlbum................: Cloudcuckooland (MCAD-6404)\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1990\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
