Doc sings and performs in what could be categorised asseveral different styles: blues, old-time, fiddle tunes, gospel and more.This compilation focusses on one particular style: country blues. Some compilations can feel like they&amp;#039;ve just been thrown together. This one doesn&amp;#039;t. It feels like someone who actually cares put it together. It&amp;#039;s very representative of his work and it&amp;#039;s good and chunky. If you&amp;#039;ve already got lots of Doc&amp;#039;s work then maybe there&amp;#039;s not likely to be much new here. But it might still be worth buying just as a great CD. If you&amp;#039;re looking for a cross section of Doc&amp;#039;s work then this is well worth it.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80acfdf566c3152629564a9515ca4c093d48549a","amp;dn":"Trouble+in+Mind%3A+Doc+Watson+Country+Blues+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80acfdf566c3152629564a9515ca4c093d48549a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,172,253,245,102,195,21,38,41,86,74,149,21,202,76,9,61,72,84,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
