His styles have changed over the years but his life is and always will be dedicated to making some of the most controversial, shocking, and aggressive music possible. He started off doing death metal after moving to Colorado in 1995 from Moscow, Russia where he was born and raised. Then in 1999 when he felt his English had improved enough to write rhymes he started rapping. Joining forces with his longtime business partner, Sevill to form DL (Denver Lowlifes) they recorded their first demo &quot;On The Edge&quot;. \n\n This low quality recording showed that even though Scum's delivery and rhymes were far from perfect, the content was so extreme and offensive that it attracted a variety of listeners and motivated Scum to continue rapping. In early 2000 Scum was joined by another local artist to form a duo called LnG and founded Lyrikal Snuff Productionz. They spent 2001 in the studio and in early 2002, the labels first official release, &quot;Lyrikal Snuff&quot; was out in stores throughout Colorado. Due to its graphic and violent content the CD was banned by a variety of stores making it hard to distribute.\n\n Shortly after the release the duo broke up in the middle of recording their sophomore album &quot;Murderous Intentionz&quot; which was never finished. At that point Scum decided to pursue his solo career and began working on &quot;Violent Verses&quot; which was temporarily abandoned when he teamed up with a local incarcerated producer who supplied him with the beats to record his first full length solo release &quot;Enter The Asylum&quot; which featured a variety of local talent and was out in stores in early 2003. At that time with almost no break, Scum went back to the studio and finished recording &quot;Violent Verses&quot; which was mainly self produced aside for a few tracks that were done by guest producers. \n\n In late 2003 the album was completed and released on LSP in early 2004. From there the real struggle began. Slowly but surely getting the CD's in stores throughout the country, performing numerous shows, setting up street teams to promote and distribute his releases. Scum has performed everywhere, from small 21 and up clubs to larger all age venues, he has done them all. As the fan base grew so did Scum's lyrical and performing skills. In 2005 he began working with Fiasco Andretti who became the labels executive producer and returned to the studio to record one of his bestselling albums to date, &quot;Only Bodies Left Behind&quot; which featured multiple collaborations with respected artists from all over the country. Due to the extreme graphic content of the artwork for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only Bodies Left BehindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ it was turned down by a variety of manufactures and there were numerous delays so the CD didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come out until January 2006. \n\n 2006 was a busy year for Scum and his crew. Establishing GoreFest (an annual all day horrorcore festival in CO), touring, online and street promotions, printing and selling a wide variety of merchandise, setting up store distribution for his releases, recruiting new street teams in over 20 states, selling CD's and merch all over the world, doing a variety of radio and TV interviews, recording more collaborations and appearing on various compilations and mixtapes. At the same time Scum was working on engineering and releasing an album for another LSP artist that featured him on a variety of collaboration tracks. Scum also joined The 4 Horzemen, a group that consisted of respected horrorcore artists from various countries and they released their debut EP &quot;Unholy Ressurrection&quot;.\n\n Later that year, Scum decided to expand LSP and signed more artists, getting involved in recording, mixing and co-producing their upcoming releases. Over the next 2 years Scum sold thousands of albums and hundreds of various shirts independently with no distribution deal. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performed with numerous local and national artists and has established a dedicated fan base all over the world. In 2007, Scum dropped his most extreme release yet &quot;Dinner's Served&quot; which instantly became a horrorcore classic and is still selling strong!! Scum also formed another group project called Hate Magnet, which is much different from any of his previous work and is a very heavy, guitar driven, moshpit oriented duo which targets metal listeners. More LSP releases and multiple live performances followed. \n\n In 2008 Scum did numerous collaborations and appeared on multiple albums worldwide which helped to further increase his fan base and gain his music more exposure overseas. New merchandise and jewelry hit the stores and was selling better than ever, more LSP albums came out featuring Scum's work, and many more shows, CD release parties, and signings followed all across the U.S. Then in early 2009 Scum's most recent and most diverse release to date, &quot;Bleed 4 This&quot; (with artwork done by one of the most respected gore artists in the world and collaborations with some of the best known horrorcore artists) hit the stores. This album featured a variety of horror themed tracks that appealed to his die hard fans while also having a lot more experimental songs that helped Scum gain new supporters and be heard on a larger scale. Immediately following this release Scum increased the amount of live performances he was doing even further to better promote the album. He recruited new street teams, online promoters and came out with a wide selection of brand new merchandise to accommodate to his growing cult following throughout the world. This album also allowed him to generate more internet and college radio plays with some of the songs.\n\n In 2009 Scum also appeared on a variety of releases worldwide bringing the total number of albums that he has been featured on to over 60! Scum performed at the 2008 and 2009 Gathering Of The Juggalos events (he was invited to but unable to attend 2007 GOTJ due to a death in the immediate family) and has done shows almost every week while finding time to record, run his label and manage the artists signed to it, run his booking and promotion business, and spend time with his family.\n\nNo rest for the wicked!\n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like Scum then buy all his shit, please support the artists you like this is years of hard work. Leave a comment &amp; rate this download &amp; please seed this takes alot of time &amp; effort I cant do it all myself.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47692837fd31ab2f76f25106c5c5096b6841c66e","amp;dn":"Scum+Discography+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47692837fd31ab2f76f25106c5c5096b6841c66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,105,40,55,253,49,171,47,118,242,81,6,197,197,9,107,104,65,198,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
