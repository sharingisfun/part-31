I will seed daily.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Amazon: The teachings of Tolle are deceptively simple. Here he continues his teaching on the benefits of focusing on the now and being present in the moment. He has a low-key manner that is easy to listen to and to follow. With self-conscious humility Tolle breaks down his ideas into simple concepts that together offer a glimpse into the profound. He takes his subject matter seriously but not himself, and sprinkles in a light dose of humor. The recording has some of the drawbacks of a live recording, from a baby crying to some volume unevenness, but the energy of the presentation offsets any such shortcomings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e3bd4467b19d6ab7235756bdccffc5d2078d39","amp;dn":"Eckhart+Tolle+-+Through+the+Open+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e3bd4467b19d6ab7235756bdccffc5d2078d39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,227,189,68,103,177,157,106,183,35,87,86,189,204,255,197,210,7,141,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
