Young Mara Prince is at the top of the world, a global celebrity in a culture that prizes physical achievement above all else. After she manifests supernatural abilities on live TV, she becomes famous all over again but for the worst reasons. Integrating themes of superpowers, celebrity worship, corporate power, feminism, and political brinksmanship, MARA takes a classic genre to new places.\n\nenjoy &amp; seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5273710b6d3a1bc3733358e6fb3154050cc05e2f","amp;dn":"Mara+001+%282012%29+%28digital%29+%28Son_of_Ultron-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5273710b6d3a1bc3733358e6fb3154050cc05e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,115,113,11,109,58,27,195,115,51,88,230,251,49,84,5,12,192,94,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
