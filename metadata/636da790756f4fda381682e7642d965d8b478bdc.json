I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a text messaging plan. I paid 25 cents to get fired.\n\nYour girlfriend dumped you, your car broke down, your boss passed you up for the big promotion.

Covering every disastrous pratfall in love, work, family-life, and more, F My Life proffers other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruinous, real-life happenings to brighten your gloomiest day: someone getting dumped through a greeting card, ignored at their birthday party, or insulted by their own grandmother.

So today, take solace in knowing that at least youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not that guy. There now, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you feel better?\n\nToday, my boyfriend broke up with me. I cried and told him that I loved him. He gave me a quarter and told me to call someone who cared. I threw the quarter in his face and ran. I waited for the bus, but when I got on, I realized I was 25 cents short of the fare. I walked home in the rain. \n\nToday, my mom walked in on me looking at a 1978 Playboy. She asked if I found it in the basement. I said yes. Then I realized she was the centerfold. \n\nToday, I got in line at the grocery store.
