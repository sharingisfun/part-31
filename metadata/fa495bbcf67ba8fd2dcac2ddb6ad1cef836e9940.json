The Best of the Early Years (1967-69)\n(pre Parliament) 256kbps\n\n&quot;Here for the first time are some of George Clinton's earliest recordings. Before P.Funk, before Parliament or Funkadelic, George Clinton and his cohorts were a stand up Detroit based vocal group in the best tradition of The Temptations. They enjoyed a major US hit (#3 R&amp;B chart) and UK club favourite &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot; for the tiny Revilot label first released in the UK on the Who's label Track records.\n\nGC's Parliafunkadelicment Thang's mass attack had been gathering momentum for years, rooted in the 1960s recordings on this CD, the first signs that a strange metamorphosis was beginning to stir within a previously unexceptional soul group. With the changing personnel and no luck but bad luck, George had been nurturing The Parliaments since his teenage doowop days in the 1950s.\nListening to these recordings again with the dubious benefit of murky hindsight, it sounds to me that some were recorded with Motown session men moonlighting down the road but the majority feature the newly assembled aggregation that would evolve into Funkadelic. Or maybe it was a come-as-you-please party: who wants to play on this one? It is also possible that some vocals and extra instrumentation might have been dubbed over existing rhythm tracks.&quot; \n\nTrack Listing:\n01. (I Wanna) Testify 3:04\n02.
