Discover the ip address and available services for each network device. Run a speed test to check your internet connection speed.\r\nPortScan shows all open ports and additional information like host name, MAC address, HTTP, SMB, FTP, iSCSI, SMTP, SNMP, MySQL and MongoDB services. Up to 100 threads are used for scaning large ip address ranges.\r\nSearch Devices\r\n\r\nYou can search for UPnP enabled devices, Bonjour services, Netgear router, Synology NAS devices, Epson projectors, Samsung printer, HP printer (SLP / Service Location Protocol), MSA network devices, Freecom network devices and IPv6 devices. So you can find them even if you donâ€™t know the ip address.\r\nPing Devices\r\n\r\nPing any computer with 3 standard sized ping packets, with 3 different sizes, each 10 times or ping the computer continuously. A graph shows the distribution of response times.\r\nSpeed Test\r\n\r\nTest your internet connection speed by downloading and uploading data to various servers. Also a latency test and a open port test is included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n* Unrar with winrar/winzip/7zip...\r\n\r\n\r\n* Just Run to use...\r\n\r\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a1d7979aff458d23601af7ecc342db06acabcd","amp;dn":"PortScan+%26amp%3B+Stuff+1.55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a1d7979aff458d23601af7ecc342db06acabcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,161,215,151,154,255,69,141,35,96,26,247,236,195,66,219,6,172,171,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
