Mauldin to avoid the provisions of a 1956 contract that Holly had signed with Decca Records, that would have prevented the release of their then-new recording of &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; on the Brunswick label. The name stuck, and for the next 15 months, there were records by the Crickets and records by Buddy Holly -- which were virtually interchangeable -- and they were billed as Buddy Holly &amp; the Crickets. By the end of 1958, however, the references to &quot;Buddy Holly and the Crickets&quot; were becoming valid in the worst possible way -- Holly's shifting and expanding musical interests, coupled with his move to New York and marriage to Maria Elena Santiago, and the differing relationships that the three had with their manager, Norman Petty, led to a split between Holly and his bandmates in the months immediately prior to Holly's death in a plane crash on February 3, 1959.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crickets-p3988/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crickets-p3988/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Bruce Eder\n\nBGO's reissue of California Sun and The Crickets: A Collection, combining the two LPs on one CD -- with a slight reshuffling of two songs that were on both albums -- assembles virtually all of the Crickets' late recordings for Liberty Records. The group's sound is surprisingly similar at times to their classic sides with Buddy Holly, despite the fact that drummer/singer/songwriter Jerry Allison is the only original member along for much of the material here -- his fluid, almost melodic percussive style is well represented, and singer/guitarist Sonny Curtis, and vocalist Jerry Naylor, make decent successors to Holly, at least as performers; Allison, Curtis, and producer Bud Cason all contribute to the songwriting, giving the group a supply of originals comparable to what they had in their heyday, and several are well above average, if not classics along the lines of &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; or &quot;Peggy Sue.&quot; The Lennon-McCartney songs covered are a mixed bag, several of them enlightening and all of them worth hearing. This was the last body of songs that the Crickets did as a contemporary group, before they were transformed into an oldies act. The sound is excellent and the annotation is reasonably thorough.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-collection-california-sun-she-loves-you-r2058460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-collection-california-sun-she-loves-you-r2058460&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=========\n\nA Collection\nAMG Review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-crickets-a-collection-r34268/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-crickets-a-collection-r34268/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCalifornia Sun - She Loves You\nAMG Review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/california-sun-she-loves-you-r4790/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/california-sun-she-loves-you-r4790/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011NW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011NW&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
