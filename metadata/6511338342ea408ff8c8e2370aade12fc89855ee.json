By the spring, or perhaps sooner, the Nameless One and his forces will be at the walls of the great city of Avendoom.\n\nUnless Shadow Harold, master thief, can find some way to stop them.\n\nEpic fantasy at its best, Shadow Prowler is the first in a trilogy that follows Shadow Harold on his quest for a magic Horn that will restore peace to the Kingdom of Siala. Harold will be accompanied on his quest by an Elfin princess, Miralissa, her elfin escort, and ten Wild Hearts, the most experienced and dangerous fighters in their world.and by the king's court jester (who may be more than he seems - or less).\n\nShadow Chaser\nSaddened because they have left one of their number in a grave in the wilderness, Harold and his companions continue their journey to the dreaded underground palace of Hrad Spein. There, knowing that armies of warriors and wizards before them have failed, they must fight legions of untold, mysterious powers before they can complete their quest for the magic horn that will save their beloved land from The Nameless One. But before they can even reach their goal, they must overcome all manner of obstacles, fight many battlesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and evade the frightful enemies on their trail.\n\nShadow Chaser is a novel of intricate plots, surprising twists and finely drawn characters that will not leave you when you put the book down. Shadow Chaser is truly something different in the world of fantasy, something special; it is something truly Russian, a fantasy that is gripping and haunting, fascinating and imaginative.\n\nShadow Blizzard\nShadow Blizzard is the third book by the international bestselling fantasy author Alexey Pehov.
