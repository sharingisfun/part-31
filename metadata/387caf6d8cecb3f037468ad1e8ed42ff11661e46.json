UN Environment Program: 200 Species Extinct Every Day, Unlike Anything Since Dinosaurs Disappeared 65 Million Years Ago. According to the UN Environment Program, the Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction of life.\n\nScientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;background&quot; rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65m years ago.\n\nMany people (dis-informed people) were saying they don't seed or spray the sky's, and well... all I have to do is look up or look at the documents I have to show these are plain ignorant to facts and data. Maybe they are in denial.\n\n&quot;The Images in this video show jets airliners and equipment used for jets airliners. No implied meaning other than &quot;airliner&quot; equipment is intended.

Definitions of the term are not universally accepted. The global extraction of hydrocarbons from the sub-surface using integrated geoscience and engineering technology has been termed 'petroleum geoengineering' as an activity with global impact. The Oxford English Dictionary defines geoengineering as &quot;the deliberate large-scale manipulation of an environmental process that affects the earth's climate, in an attempt to counteract the effects of global warming.&quot;\n\nSide effects\n\nThe techniques themselves may cause significant foreseen or unforeseen harm. For example, the use of reflective balloons may result in significant litter, which may be harmful to wildlife.\n\nOzone depletion is a risk of some geoengineering techniques, notably those involving sulfur delivery into the stratosphere.\n\nThe active nature of geoengineering may in some cases create a clear division between winners and losers. Most of the proposed interventions are regional, such as albedo modification in the Arctic.\n\nThere may be unintended climatic consequences, such as changes to the hydrological cycle including droughts or floods, caused by the geoengineering techniques, but possibly not predicted by the models used to plan them. Such effects may be cumulative or chaotic in nature, making prediction and control very difficult.\n\n    Category\n\n    Nonprofits &amp; Activism\n    License\n\n    Standard YouTube License\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387caf6d8cecb3f037468ad1e8ed42ff11661e46","amp;dn":"Chemtrails+connected+to+UN+2013+Report++%27Earth+is+in+the+midst+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387caf6d8cecb3f037468ad1e8ed42ff11661e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,124,175,109,140,236,179,240,55,70,138,209,232,237,66,255,17,102,30,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
