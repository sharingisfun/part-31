And while bagpipes are a major component of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no bombast or overkill in their usage. The closing track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDodeca MeditaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the perfect example, a layering of three bagpipes with an almost medieval sound, yet played with a delicacy rarely found in true Celtic music. The group performs in two different configurations, as the Griff trio with the three bagpipers, Remi Decker, Raphael De Cock (who does all the singing), and Birgit Bornauw; and, on this recording, as Griff, with the addition of accordion, guitar, and double bass.\n\nThe band plays a wide range of traditional material in various languages. The title track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe False FlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (a variation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalse Knight on the RoadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSearchingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (A variation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs I Roved OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) are sung in English, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVisur,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a traditional song from Iceland, is sung in Icelandic, and and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLes MotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an original song by Remi Decker sung in French. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSendedirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an adaption of a Turkish poem. The instrumental pieces are mostly Decker originals, with accordionist Sara Salverius writing and taking the lead on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTourniquet.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The group also does a version of Bela FleckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSystem 7.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The band has a wonderful sense of dynamics and the arrangements make subtle use of all the instruments, including the accordion, the various styles of bagpipes (uilleann, Flemish, small pipes) and whistles. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a refreshing mix of new and old music without any artificial borders.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebc03b4f6709c9b34ce57237e5ffb8059cdbac0","amp;dn":"Griff...The+False+Fly%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ebc03b4f6709c9b34ce57237e5ffb8059cdbac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,188,3,180,246,112,156,155,52,206,87,35,126,95,251,128,89,205,186,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
