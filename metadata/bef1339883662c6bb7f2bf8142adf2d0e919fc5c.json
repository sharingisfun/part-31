Pharoah Sanders would join the group the following month, and Tyner and Jones would depart in January of 1966 to be replaced by Alice Coltrane and Rashied Ali. It is also one of the saxophonist's most intense taped performances. After nearly four years together, this band had achieved a vital collective identity. When Coltrane moved toward metrically free styles of rhythm and melody (with tunes often based on one chord or a short series of notes as themes), the quartet's rhythmic pulse and collective interplay evolved accordingly.\n\nHe original album featured edited and sometimes overdubbed performances of its four compositions. Sun Ship: The Complete Session delivers both complete versions of the album's performances, but also multiple takes of &quot;Dearly Beloved,&quot; &quot;Attaining,&quot; and the title track. \n\nThere are inserts where edits and overdubs were clearly made, with studio dialogue, arrangement breakdowns, false starts, etc. Disc two contains eight different takes of &quot;Ascent&quot; (including the previously released version) as well as alternate and released takes of &quot;Amen,&quot; and studio conversation. Author David Wild's detailed liner essay eloquently details the process in the album's creation and problems encountered, adding a keen insight into Bob Theile's and Coltrane's production methods and aesthetics. A set like this is obviously intended for the saxophonist's devotees, critics, and jazz historians, but even a casual listen offers a fascinating look at how different these sessions were from the final product.\n\nThe new release Sun Ship: The Complete Session 2-CD set is the result of an extraordinary discovery: the entire session as it was recorded on August 26, 1965, with Trane, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones, with producer Bob Thiele. Newly mixed and remastered in high-resolution audio, this special release includes every recorded moment from the session:\n- all alternate takes\n- conversation between the musicians, their leader and their producer\n- more than one hour of unreleased music\n\nThe 16-page booklet features an essay by renowned Coltrane scholar David Wild and rare photos by Chuck Stewart, who shot the original album cover.\nSun Ship: The Complete Session is a rare, essential snapshot of an icon at work Ã¢â‚¬â€ the evolution of a masterpiece.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01.
