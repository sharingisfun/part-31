When you're out on the street in the middle of the night wearing your little French Maid outfit, with the short skirt and the off-the-shoulder top, Jack Daniels isn't just your friend, it's your coat. And the 9mm in your tray isn't just your protection - it's the compass that points you the way home.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3771&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Guns-Kirsten-Baldock/dp/1932051368&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Smoke-Guns-Kirsten-Baldock/dp/1932051368&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nSmoke and Guns Graphic Novel Preview.cbr 4.09 MB\n\nSmoke and Guns.cbz 39.2 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ae75bcd438de6776de62527f7aaa94dab5e333d","amp;dn":"Smoke+and+Guns+%28Reseed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ae75bcd438de6776de62527f7aaa94dab5e333d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,231,91,205,67,141,230,119,109,230,37,39,247,170,169,77,171,94,51,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
