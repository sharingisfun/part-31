This concert took place in a Marine Park (field) with no seating, so the camera work is not as impressive as the recent USA gigs. With that said the people who did film this did a great job considering the environment they were in.\n\nProduced By Marknow\n\nFilmed By\nkesamoenoi \n518MT\nshirotopooh\nes2012v\nriddle601\nvamglam76\n\nMega Link:\n\n1.
