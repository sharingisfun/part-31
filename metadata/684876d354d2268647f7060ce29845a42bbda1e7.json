Xaviant in the production of the game wanted to pay more attention to magic to create the separate &quot;Ã¥Â·Â«Ã¥Â¦â€“Ã¥â€ºÂ½ degree&quot; and other RPG games area. Production team managed this feature is called &quot;mantra core&quot; kind of magic is very limited, but through constant development, will extend some unique new magic.\n\nDevelopment group, said: &quot;Magic game is really important, and we will be very deep magic to create the system, the game requires players to constantly hone will initially be given to the players several completely different magic, players through constant practice to use. enhance its power, and then add some pharmaceutical and other items you can create a number of new and unique spells, new magic items and will be based on the latest ways to use magic you use to decide. &quot;\n\nXaviant mentioned in the subsequent development of the market, there are three games have a deep impact on them, that is, &quot;No Man's Land,&quot; &quot;Soul of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot; series of games each providing a different great help.\n\nHe said: &quot;&quot; Ã¥Â·Â«Ã¥Â¦â€“Ã¥â€ºÂ½ degree &quot;affected by three different game first, gameplay largely borrowed from&quot; No Man's Land &quot;action figures, monster behavior, class upgrades, encounters etc.. etc. Second, our boss battles draw in the &quot;darkness of the soul&quot;, large size, powerful ability to give players a very rich mix to fight, unlike ordinary boss battle a routine down ok. Finally is equipped trophy is based on the &quot;Diablo&quot; to collect rare items for a different game journey of great help. &quot;\n\nXaviant though independent development group, but ambition is not small, for their new work, &quot;Wu Yaoguo degree&quot; is also very confident. By drawing on three different RPG masterpiece, plus a unique magic system, I believe it will create a distinctive RPG game.\n\nConfiguration Requirements\n\nMinimum:\n\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8, Windows 8.1\nProcessor: Quad-core 2.80 GHz\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: 1024 MB Graphics Card (tested on AMD Radeon HD 7790 and NVIDIA GTX 750)\nDirectX: Version 11\nHard Drive: 12 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: The initial Early Access build is not thoroughly optimized or tested on a wide range of hardware, so our minimum spec requirements are conservative, with a target of 30 FPS at 1920X1080 resolution on Medium graphics settings Supports Microsoft Xbox 360 Wired Controller..\n\nRecommended:\n\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8, Windows 8.1\nProcessor: Quad-core 3.5 GHz\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: 1024 MB Graphics Card (tested on AMD Radeon HD 7970 and NVIDIA GTX 670)\nDirectX: Version 11\nHard Drive: 12 GB available space\nAdditional Notes:.
