Determined to track Reynolds down, the Kid is stopping stagecoaches and sifting through the mail for letters addressed to the killer. This earns him a reputation as a stagecoach hold-up artist even though he steals nothing. This misconception is reinforced by the fact that his sidekick, Laramie, is a notorious half-breed outlaw. \n\n-Lights of Old Santa Fe (1947) \nThe Roy Rogers movie &quot;Lights Of Old Santa Fe&quot; is a classic Roy Rogers movie. It features Roy Rogers, his golden palomino stallion Trigger, Dale Evans, Gabby Hayes, the Sons Of The Pioneers, and a light, entertaining plot with just enough singing, action, and bad guys to keep things interesting. Dale Evans is once again at her best in this one, playing a feisty role that brings out the chemistry between herself and Roy Rogers, reminding us why their movie personas have been internationally popular and famous for decades.\n\n-MY PAL TRIGGER (1946)\n  Roy is unjustly blamed in the shooting death of GabbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horse. Popular character actor Jack Holt (San Francisco) is the actual shooter. This film was reportedly a personal favorite of RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. \n\n-In Old Caliete (1939)\nSet after California's Statehood but before the War Between the States, Roy Rogers is working for a wealthy Spanish family. One of their men is secretly betraying the arrival of targets of opportunity to a group of Anglo American bandits but puts the blame on Roy.\n\n-Cowboy and the Senorita (1944)\nRoy and his sidekick Teddy Bear are mistaken for the kidnappers of a runaway teenager. After escaping from a posse the two find the teenager, Chip who explains their innocence and has her sister Ysobel and her soon to be husband the rich Craig Allen give the pair jobs. Chip tells Roy she is sure her late father had riches hidden away that the unscrupulous Craig Allen tries to take for himself.\n\n-THE BELLS OF SAN ANGELO (1947) \n Roy is a border guard who suspects (correctly) that is smuggling silver out of a Mexican mine and &quot;planting&quot; it in his own worthless silver mine! John McGuire (Sands of Iwo Jima) is the culprit, and movie favorite Andy Devine (Stagecoach) plays the sheriff!
