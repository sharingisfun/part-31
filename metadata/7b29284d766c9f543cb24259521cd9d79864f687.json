Uninvited   \n\nThough Morissette is known for songs driven by big, hard-hitting production, her larger-than-life sound translates surprisingly well to a stripped-down, acoustic-based approach. Backed by acoustic guitar, piano, and strings (and a tasteful rhythm section), Alanis scales down the grand scale of her arrangements for a more intimate, directly communicative effect. Listening to the almost gentle version of the formerly piledriving &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; will provide something of a revelation for Morissette's fans. The scathing lyrics achieve an even more cathartic effect with the contrasting feel of the music, and the singer/songwriter is revealed as a folk-rocker at heart.\n\nHer previously noted preference for the confessional mode is further underlined here by an earnest version of the Police's soul-searching plaint &quot;King of Pain.&quot; Thankfully, Morissette has enough common sense to avoid changing it to &quot;Queen of Pain.&quot; The unfettered swoops and glides of her vocal style have more room to flow here as well, and Morissette sounds a bird in full flight throughout.\n\nPersonnel: Alanis Morissette (vocals, guitar, flute, harmonica); Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley (guitar); Joel Derouin, Laura Seaton (violin); David Campbell (viola); Erik Friedlander, Suzie Katayama (cello); Deron Johnson (keyboards, background vocals); Gary Novak (drums, percussion); \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b29284d766c9f543cb24259521cd9d79864f687","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morissette+-+MTV+Unplugged+%281999%29EAC.FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b29284d766c9f543cb24259521cd9d79864f687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,41,40,77,118,108,159,84,60,178,66,89,82,28,217,215,152,100,246,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
