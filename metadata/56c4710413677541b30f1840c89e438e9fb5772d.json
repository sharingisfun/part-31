One of the returning soldiers, (played effectively by Frank Sinatra) however, has recurring dreams of his platoon being brainwashed and Shaw committing acts of murder.\n\nHe eventually convinces army brass that Shaw is still a puppet of his Communist-Marxist operators...\n\n\nKeep in mind while you watch this that John McCain spent two years in solitary as a POW. No one but his captors would know for sure what was done to him. Not even McCain himself. I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t think he can be trusted with his finger on the button.\nThis movie is fictional, brainwashing is not. \n\nCheck out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_ultra \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c4710413677541b30f1840c89e438e9fb5772d","amp;dn":"The+Manchurian+Candidate+%281962%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c4710413677541b30f1840c89e438e9fb5772d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,196,113,4,19,103,117,65,179,15,24,64,200,158,67,142,159,181,119,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
