The premature success of 'Diaspora' preceded a few years out of the music world before returning in 2005 with a label and renewed enthusiasm. A steadily growing flow of production inspiration led to James topping the Beatport charts in 2008 before a resultant increase in DJ bookings and remix offers changed the focus for the subsequent few years. Toward the end of 2012, James decided to take a step away from the DJ circuit and slow down on original productions and gigs, instead focusing on his label and to enjoy family life and other interests. Whilst the music industry was widely considered to be suffering due to digital piracy, lack of A&amp;R quality control and some unhealthy musical trends - the lack of DJ commitments meant James returned to a pure and natural approach to music production, free from trends but with a conscious focus on quality. Fast forward to the start of 2014 and it was time to return to the studio - this time with a debut album. Recorded on and off during January and February, the objective was to work with focus, unhurried - but without significant gaps - on a richer, more melodic and intricate sound, free from constraints and parameters but with a greater emphasis on finer details. The resultant work is entitled &quot;Music For the Weak And The Wounded&quot; - a title inspired by the more extreme experiences of the late 90's club scene in London, a period which remains a core inspiration on his work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a1e2d7c0bd40b12af8cfffe79890c30bccb5ea","amp;dn":"James+Harcourt+-+Music+For+The+Weak+And+The+Wounded+%282014%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a1e2d7c0bd40b12af8cfffe79890c30bccb5ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,161,226,215,192,189,64,177,42,248,207,255,231,152,144,195,11,204,181,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
