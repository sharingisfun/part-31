Setup wouldn't run on XP/7, so it involved some VMware, Windows 95, bunch of manual DLL integrations, a FTP server, special graphics drivers, but ta-dam!\n\nDidn't run it yet as I wanted to provide as clean as possible a torrent, so take a look at the readme, you'll probably need DOSBox as well, you know the drill. Or, figure it out. Enjoy and seed. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db101e43c9db3f8d91873a66071329c624a00747","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Might+and+Magic+Archives.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db101e43c9db3f8d91873a66071329c624a00747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,16,30,67,201,219,63,141,145,135,58,102,7,19,41,198,36,160,7,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
