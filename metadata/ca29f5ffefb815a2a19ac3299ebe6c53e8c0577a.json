Johnny has nowhere to turn, and because gangsters tend to \n\nflourish in his neighborhood he goes to work for Dundee, a benevolent godfather-gangster type, in order to cover his mother's \n\nmedical bills. Johnny hides his association with Dundee from his younger brother Tommy (Griffin Dunne) and goes so far as to \n\npay for Tommy's law school fees -- supporting him until Tommy joins the staff of the local (and corrupt) district attorney's \n\noffice for Burr (Danny DeVito). When Johnny starts working for Dundee, he clashes with the evil Vermin (Joe Piscopo) right \n\nfrom the beginning, but things only get worse. After Dundee decides to retire, Johnny ascends to the helm, and it does not \n\nlook like Vermin is going to take that sitting down.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated PG-13\n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t21 December 1984\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 5294 Kbps\n         * Audio - English, French, Spanish\n         * Subs  - English, French, Spanish\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
