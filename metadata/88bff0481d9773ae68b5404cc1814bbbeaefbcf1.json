It was released as a single in 1993 and can be heard on the soundtrack to the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero, as well as during reruns of the Savage Nation talk show as bumper music. It was later released on the 2009 box set Backtracks. It became the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first No. 1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart in 1993.\n\nAC/DC has only played the song live once during 1996 rehearsals but never at an official show, even though it is considered a fan favourite.\n\n\nLast Action Hero is a 1993 American action-comedy-fantasy film directed and produced by John McTiernan. It is a satire of the action genre and its clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Big Gun\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (AC/DC) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24   : ONLY THIS SONG IS INCLUDED\n\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;What the Hell Have I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Alice in Chains) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Angry Again\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Megadeth) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Real World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Michael Kamen and QueensrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿che) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Two Steps Behind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Def Leppard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Poison My Eyes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Anthrax) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:04\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Dream On\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; [Live] - (Aerosmith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;A Little Bitter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Alice in Chains) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cock the Hammer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Cypress Hill) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Swim\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Fishbone) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Last Action Hero\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Tesla) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Jack and the Ripper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; - (Michael Kamen &amp; Buckethead) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n\n\nREAPER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bff0481d9773ae68b5404cc1814bbbeaefbcf1","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.Last+Action+Hero%3A+Music+from+the+Original+Motion+Picture.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bff0481d9773ae68b5404cc1814bbbeaefbcf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,191,240,72,29,151,115,174,104,181,64,76,193,129,75,187,234,239,188,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
