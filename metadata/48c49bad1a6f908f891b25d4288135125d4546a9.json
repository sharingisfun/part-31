This is the most accessible Annie-release this far and should gain more listeners than any of our other releases.\nThink somewhere between Built to Spill, the Weakerthans, Death Cab for Cutie and Superchunk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c49bad1a6f908f891b25d4288135125d4546a9","amp;dn":"Monzano+-+High+Horses+%26amp%3B+One+Trick+Ponies+%282008%29+%5BMP3+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c49bad1a6f908f891b25d4288135125d4546a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,196,155,173,26,111,144,143,137,27,37,212,40,129,53,18,93,69,70,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
