And they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stopped since doing concerts and recording Christian music.\n\nThey have traveled nearly 3 million miles with performances in over 8,000 concerts and revivals in 24 different countries.\n\nSome 33 albums (records, tapes and CDs) have now been released by the Good Twins. In 1961 they made musical history as the first to use pre-recorded background tapes at concerts -- a novel method that has since become very common.\n\nNot satisfied with piano/organ backup, their albums are orchestrated by such well-known Christian arranger /conductors as Jimmy Owens, Ralph Carmichael and Stan Endicott.\n\nA 1968 album, Church Is Finally Over, won a NEFF* award for best duet album of the year.\n\nThe Good Twins have had a special ministry to Russia since 1992. Dwight has been to Russia 29 times and is vice-president of ChildLife International (CLI). CLI brings Russian children to America who need critical life-saving operations that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be performed in Russia. \n\n\n*NEFF Awards: The National Evangelical Film Foundation awards were a forerunner to the GMA Dove Awards.
