And it was her own personal journey that inspired Elle Luna to write a brief online manifesto that, in a few short months, has touched hundreds of thousands of people whoâ€™ve read it or heard Elle speak on the topic. Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer.\r\n\r\nThe Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal messageâ€”we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. Itâ€™s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with oneâ€™s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Shouldâ€”money, time, space, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerabilityâ€”and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers whoâ€™ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap. It explains the importance of mistakes, of â€œunlearning,â€ of solitude, of keeping moving, of following a soul path.\r\n\r\nPresented in four chaptersâ€”The Crossroads, The Origin of Should, Must, and The Returnâ€”inspired by the heroâ€™s journey outlined by Joseph Campbell, The Crossroads of Should and Must guides us from the small moment, discovering our Must, to the big momentâ€”actually doing something about it, and returning to share our new gifts with the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59afd83116baa4dcfbdb00c4a7332a880eda0b71","amp;dn":"The+Crossroads+of+Should+and+Must+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59afd83116baa4dcfbdb00c4a7332a880eda0b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,175,216,49,22,186,164,220,251,219,0,196,167,51,42,136,14,218,11,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
