Cottonbelly,\nregrouped in a U.K. recording studio in June and were recording and mixing into\nOctober.\n\nThe eponymous first single has put us at ease. It's a narcotic skank with intro\nhorns that remind us of Hov's &quot;Encore&quot; and a guitar scratch smoothed by Sade's\ninimitable cool voice.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2d68e65637cdfbdfe1bbbc2d0e7ffcfc8754ac","amp;dn":"Sade+-+Soldier+Of+Love+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2d68e65637cdfbdfe1bbbc2d0e7ffcfc8754ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,45,104,230,86,55,205,251,223,225,187,188,45,14,127,252,252,135,84,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
