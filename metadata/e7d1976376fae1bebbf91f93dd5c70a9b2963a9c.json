Grace Under Pressure Tour was filmed at Maple Leaf Gardens in Rush's hometown of Toronto. Directed by music-video veteran David Mallet, it's a fine document of a band whose skills and vision had matured. But Lee, Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart were in their early 30s, so they were still running on youthful vigor. Song-wise, the usual suspects are here: &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. The biggest treats are underrated songs such as &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot;, and &quot;Red Sector A&quot;, all strong Grace Under Pressure cuts. Rush is often thought of as humorless, but &quot;The Weapon&quot;'s playful rear-screen projection intro features SCTV comedian Joe Flaherty in his Count Floyd guise. The anti-censorship &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; from Rush's 1981 masterpiece Moving Pictures foreshadowed the decade's conservative hysteria about the arts. Perhaps the most fun song is &quot;New World Man&quot;, which, at this point, remains Rush's only Top 40 hit single. Lee butchers his vocals a little at the end, but Lifeson coolly and casually leans back against a speaker while firing off his riffs, and at one point the normally stoic Peart even manages a smile. The finale is a three-song medley of &quot;Vital Signs&quot; and the rudimentary pre-Peart cuts &quot;Finding My Way&quot; and &quot;In the Mood.&quot;\n\nThe setlist:\n01.
