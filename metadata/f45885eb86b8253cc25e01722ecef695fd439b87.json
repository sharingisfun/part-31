Ben Gibbard and Nick Harmer have both been quoted as saying that the album will be &quot;a much less guitar-centric album than weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever made before&quot;.[3] The first single, &quot;You Are a Tourist&quot;, was made available for online stream on March 28, 2011 on the band's official site[4] and the album was available for streaming in its entirety on May 23, 2011 on NPR.[5] On November 30, 2011, the album received a Nomination in the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\n1.\t&quot;Home Is A Fire&quot;  \t\t4:04\n2.\t&quot;Codes And Keys&quot;  \t\t3:22\n3.\t&quot;Some Boys&quot;  \t\t\t3:11\n4.\t&quot;Doors Unlocked And Open&quot;  \t5:37\n5.\t&quot;You Are A Tourist&quot;  \t\t4:47\n6.\t&quot;Unobstructed Views&quot;  \t\t6:11\n7.\t&quot;Monday Morning&quot;  \t\t4:19\n8.\t&quot;Portable Television&quot;  \t\t2:53\n9.\t&quot;Underneath The Sycamore&quot;  \t3:27\n10.\t&quot;St. Peter's Cathedral&quot;  \t4:30\n11.\t&quot;Stay Young, Go Dancing&quot;  \t2:50\n\nArtist: Death Cab for Cutie\nTitle: Codes And Keys\nLabel: Atlantic\nGenre: Indie\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\n\nTrack 1 - Home Is S Fire\nLength: 244 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 916 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 64%\n\nTrack 2 - Codes And Keys\nLength: 201 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 877 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 62%\n\nTrack 3 - Some Boys\nLength: 190 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 904 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 64%\n\nTrack 4 - Doors Unlocked And Open\nLength: 337 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 908 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 64%\n\nTrack 5 - You Are A Tourist\nLength: 286 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 909 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 64%\n\nTrack 6 - Unobstructed Views\nLength: 370 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 670 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 47%\n\nTrack 7 - Monday Morning\nLength: 258 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 871 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 61%\n\nTrack 8 - Portable Television\nLength: 172 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 902 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 63%\n\nTrack 9 - Underneath The Sycamore\nLength: 206 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 883 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 62%\n\nTrack 10 - St. Peters Cathedral\nLength: 270 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 791 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 56%\n\nTrack 11 - Stay Young, Go Dancing\nLength: 170 seconds\nAverage bitrate: 923 kbps\nCompression Ratio: 65%\n\nImage: http://bayimg.com/mADFcaAEo\nTags: mstr,hakr,mstrhakr,flac,free lossless audio codec,death cab for cutie,death,cab,for,cutie,codes and keys,codes,and,keys,music,rock,indie,pop,top 100,top,awesomesauce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45885eb86b8253cc25e01722ecef695fd439b87","amp;dn":"%5BFLAC%5D+Death+Cab+For+Cutie+-+Codes+and+Keys+%5BMSTR-HAKR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45885eb86b8253cc25e01722ecef695fd439b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,88,133,235,134,184,37,60,194,94,1,114,46,206,246,149,253,67,155,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
