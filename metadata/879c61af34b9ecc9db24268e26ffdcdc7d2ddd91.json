He is best known as the author of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, which started life in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a &quot;trilogy&quot; of five books that sold over 15 million copies in his lifetime, a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature film. Adamss contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academys Hall of Fame.[1]\n\nAdams also wrote Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), Last Chance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who. A posthumous collection of his work, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.\n\nAdams became known as an advocate for environmental and conservation causes, and also as a lover of fast cars, cameras, and the Apple Macintosh. He was a staunch atheist, famously imagining a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, &quot;This is an interesting world I find myself inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an interesting hole I find myself inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&quot; \n\nBiologist Richard Dawkins dedicated his book, The God Delusion (2006), to Adams, writing on his death that, &quot;Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:879c61af34b9ecc9db24268e26ffdcdc7d2ddd91","amp;dn":"Last+Chance+To+See+-+Douglas+Adams+-+128+CBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"879c61af34b9ecc9db24268e26ffdcdc7d2ddd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,156,97,175,52,185,236,201,219,36,38,142,38,255,220,220,125,45,221,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
