Nearly five years in the making, the unenviable task of \nrecording a follow-up to one of the most talked about albums of recent \ntimes has resulted in a passionate, bold and cut-throat release in the \nshape of 21st Century Breakdown.\n\nSpearheaded by fiery single 'Know Your Enemy', 21st Century Breakdown \ntells the story of a young couple, Christian and Gloria, as they \nstruggle through the promise and mess of the century so far. The album \nis divided into three acts - 'Heroes and Cons,' 'Charlatans and Saints' \nand 'Horseshoes and Handgrenades'.\n\nWith acclaimed producer Butch Vig (producer of Nirvana's seminal \nmasterpiece, 'Nevermind', among others) at the desk, 21st Century \nBreakdown is a sublime, ambitious rock album that meets every expectation. \nA rock opera of monumental proportions, the band have stated that Queen, \nThe Clash and Bruce Springsteen have influenced this release, although \nthe passionate vocal performance of Billie Joe Armstrong and the hugely \ndistinctive driving rhythm section of Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool confirm \nthat this is nothing but a stunning Green Day album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8e19aa6102bf2cfce8414b9a46e0809d37810a","amp;dn":"Green_Day-21st_Century_Breakdown-2009-BiGW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8e19aa6102bf2cfce8414b9a46e0809d37810a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,142,25,170,97,2,191,44,252,232,65,75,154,70,224,128,157,55,129,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
