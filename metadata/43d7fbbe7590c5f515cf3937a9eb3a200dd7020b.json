Led by the brilliant Irina Spalko, the Soviets tail Jones and the young man, Mutt, to Peru. With Oxley's code, they find a legendary skull made of a single piece of quartz. If Jones can deliver the skull to its rightful place, all may be well; but if Irina takes it to its origin, she'll gain powers that could endanger the West. Aging professor and young buck join forces with a woman from Jones's past to face the dangers of the jungle, Russia, and the supernatural.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d7fbbe7590c5f515cf3937a9eb3a200dd7020b","amp;dn":"Indiana+Jones+and+the+Kingdom+of+the+Crystal+Skull+%28+2008+%7C+DvDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d7fbbe7590c5f515cf3937a9eb3a200dd7020b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,215,251,190,117,144,197,245,21,207,57,55,169,235,58,32,13,215,2,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
