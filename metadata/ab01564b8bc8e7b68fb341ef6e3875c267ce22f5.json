Long recognized as the standard reference in the field, the book has been thoroughly updated to reflect the enormous changes that have taken place in the electric power industry since the Second Edition was published seventeen years ago.\n\nWith an emphasis on both the engineering and economic aspects of energy management, the Third Edition introduces central &quot;terminal&quot; characteristics for thermal and hydroelectric power generation systems, along with new optimization techniques for tackling real-world operating problems. Readers will find a range of algorithms and methods for performing integrated economic, network, and generating system analysis, as well as modern methods for power system analysis, operation, and control. Special features include:\n\nState-of-the-art topics such as market simulation, multiple market analysis, contract and market bidding, and other business topics\nChapters on generation with limited energy supply, power flow control, power system security, and more\nAn introduction to regulatory issues, renewable energy, and other evolving topics\nNew worked examples and end-of-chapter problems\nA companion website with additional materials, including MATLAB programs and power system sample data sets","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab01564b8bc8e7b68fb341ef6e3875c267ce22f5","amp;dn":"Power+Generation+Operation+and+Control+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab01564b8bc8e7b68fb341ef6e3875c267ce22f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,1,86,75,139,200,231,182,143,179,65,239,110,56,117,194,103,206,34,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
