Widely seen as his magnum opus, it is an elucidation of his Traditionalist world view.\n\nThe first part of the book deals with the concepts of the Traditional world; its knowledge of the bridge between the earthly and the transcendent worlds. The second part deals with the modern world, contrasting its characteristics with those of traditional societies: from politics and institutions to views on life and death. Evola denounces the regressive aspects of modern civilisation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc171df04966187958c9c30520dbe5ccb65e7b0c","amp;dn":"%5B1969%5D+Revolt+Against+the+Modern+World.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc171df04966187958c9c30520dbe5ccb65e7b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,23,29,240,73,102,24,121,88,201,195,5,32,219,229,204,182,94,123,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
