The player will plunge directly into the boundless scenery of the inhospitable Ural Mountains with the task to find out what really happened. In the course of events, you may come across more speculations than expected...\r\n\r\nWill you find the answer?\r\nWill you get any closer to the truth?\r\nWill you survive?\r\n\r\nDyatlov Pass incident was a real story that happened in winter of 1959. Nine skilled alpinists went for a trip to the northern part of Ural Mountains, which ended fatally. Bodies of expedition's crew were found scattered on slope of Kholat Syakhl.\r\n\r\nRussian investigators closed the case stating that &quot;a compelling unknown force&quot; had caused the deaths.\r\n\r\nstunning art design\r\nimmersive exploration experience\r\nsophisticated music and sounds\r\nchilling atmosphere and tension\r\nself made story inspired by true events\r\nmain storyline and a lot of background plot to be discovered by players\r\nnon-linear open world\r\nin-game navigation by map and compass\r\npowered by Unreal Engine 4\r\nchallenging exploration\r\nestimated game length: 4 - 6 hours\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i3\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 470\r\nDirectX: Version 10\r\nHard Drive: 5 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 8.1 64 bit\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 660 TI\r\nDirectX: Version 11\r\nHard Drive: 10 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c8e412591095f840f910d8c3e702ae61bd0f5f","amp;dn":"Kholat+%28v2.1.0.3%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c8e412591095f840f910d8c3e702ae61bd0f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,200,228,18,89,16,149,248,64,249,16,216,195,231,2,174,97,189,15,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
