The winning team was composed of writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and director John Gulager. It was executive produced by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Moore (through their LivePlanet production company), Wes Craven and the Maloof family. The film was produced and distributed by Dimension Films in association with Maloof Motion Pictures and Neo Art &amp; Logic.\n\nAs the clientele are enjoying their drinks, a man covered in blood (identified onscreen as &quot;Hero&quot;) enters through the door and warns them all of impending danger, but no one heeds his warning. To prove his point he exposes the head of a repulsive monster. Soon after this he is promptly pulled through a window and decapitated by one of the monsters following him, ironic as it was implied just before his death that his chances of survival were very high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdf9f935ae58e6c366d9ed140a89e592b3f1260","amp;dn":"Feast+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdf9f935ae58e6c366d9ed140a89e592b3f1260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,223,159,147,90,229,142,108,54,109,158,209,64,168,158,89,43,63,18,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
