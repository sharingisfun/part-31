Although they enjoyed a little less than a year of serious chart success, the Merseybeats were unable to pull together the various facets of their sound into a cohesive, coherent whole in the manner of the Beatles or the Hollies, and into something lasting, in part because of a lack of original songwriting ability in their ranks. The group's roots go back to the early '60s in Liverpool, and a band originally known as &quot;the Mavericks,&quot; comprised of Tony Crane (lead guitar, vocals), Billy Kinsley (bass, vocals), David Elias (rhythm guitar, vocals), and Frank Sloane (drums). They were doing well but soon found the name to be a drag on their success, making people think that they were a country &amp; western band. They briefly used the name &quot;the Pacifics,&quot; and then became the Merseybeats -- evidently their timing was such that they grabbed the name, previously a local music reference, ahead of anyone else in a city boiling over with musical activity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-merseybeats-p4903/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-merseybeats-p4903/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nSpectrum's The Very Best of the Merseybeats is a good budget-line U.K. collection featuring all of the group's Top 30 hits, plus a selection of good lesser-known singles and album tracks that often equal the originals. If you can't find Beat &amp; Ballads this is a good alternative.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-the-merseybeats-spectrum-r365719&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-the-merseybeats-spectrum-r365719&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006V63&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006V63&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
