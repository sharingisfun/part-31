Another Mammal artist is Benjamin Marra, and while Raw Edge doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read as something Marra would have created, it reads like the product of someone who shares MarraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest for better or for Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ well, just better, really. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a science fiction setting similar to what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d find in Blade Runner, Akira, or whatever author those particular things was inspired by or stole from, populated by a bunch of hot-tempered characters going through the selfish, noir-staple motions required. The only hint that Clark might not be taking it seriously isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found in the story or dialogÃ¢â‚¬â€œthereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no real irony or winking to be foundÃ¢â‚¬â€œbut in the cover, where the cover logo combines a BMX Bandits font with the steel italics youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d see on a cereal box, if the cereal had some sort of industrial characters hanging out on a scaffolding. Likability goes a long way, and this one has way more than it even needs. On second thought, this is as good as my wry cowboy. Hell, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost better.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d3dc83362ec679559664ce9f22340c7001bcce","amp;dn":"Devin+Clark%3A+The+Raw+Edge+%23+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d3dc83362ec679559664ce9f22340c7001bcce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,211,220,131,54,46,198,121,85,150,100,206,159,34,52,12,112,1,188,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
