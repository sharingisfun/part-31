That is, until he falls for someone else's girlfriend and discovers he can control the powers of nature-most of the time. Suddenly, people he never knew existed want to control him, fearing what he can do, or manipulate him for their own purposes. When he learns that his best friend's death might not have been an accident, his search for the truth uncovers a deadly conspiracy. If he's going to catch his friend's killer and prevent many more lives from being lost, he must figure out who he can trust and gain control of his powers before he becomes the biggest danger of all. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b058a3c3273f7f4f0257f525921d687c5f17a4a3","amp;dn":"Power+Revealed+%28The+Elementers%29-+Berry%2C+Leah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b058a3c3273f7f4f0257f525921d687c5f17a4a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,88,163,195,39,63,127,79,2,87,245,37,146,29,104,124,95,23,164,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
