This was their first album featuring new drummer Barriemore Barlow. Its lyrics are built around a poem written by a fictitious boy, &quot;Gerald Bostock&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Little Milton&quot; (Ian Anderson himself). The album featured only one song, lasting over 43 minutes. To accommodate the album on LP vinyl and cassette, the seamless track was split on both sides of the record. It reached number one on the (U.S.) Billboard Pop Albums chart.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e987043f5fd4bc519858acde35deeee5c4767813","amp;dn":"Jehtro+Tull+-+Thick+as+a+Brick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e987043f5fd4bc519858acde35deeee5c4767813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,135,4,63,95,212,188,81,152,88,172,222,53,222,238,229,196,118,120,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
