He correctly and courageously pins a lot of America's backwardness on those millions who would prefer to contemplate a perfect non-existent world to a real world that needs plenty of fixing.\n\nMaher was host of TV's Politically Incorrect until it was shanghaied, likely because he did the non-cognitive-dissonant thing and said the 9/11 terrorists were brave men (which they were, in addition to being sociopathic religious fanatics). At times, Maher is the measured, gentlemanly &quot;but seriously folks&quot; sideman to Jon Stewart's rebelliousness: capable of taking a blimp-launching nutter like Ron Paul and polishing him up to the point where Ron Paul.com feels like officially linking to the I-view. But that's the point: every night, and every time Maher opens his mouth, he makes someone mad.\n\nNOTES: I found the best HD copy available and synced the UNCENSORED audio to it, then added the last 6 minutes of the video (after main show) from a 480p copy I found on youtube so the video quality is excellent, except for the last 6 minutes where you can tell its from a lower quality source but it was the best I could find. Hope everybody enjoys this.\n\nThis rip is &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7c4b4e4c04484c483c4e4552454b1a0c0f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;@~1200kbps with 2ch stereo aac sound@192kbps\n\nPlease seed if you download, thanx!\n\nEXTRA NOTE: sorry guys, in the actual filename it says ac3 instead of acc because I was copy and pasting the name from the 720p rip that I encoded.
