You take the role of Zitz, the third Battletoad, and it's up to you to save your friends from the Queen. In order to rescue your buddies you will have to travel to the Planet Armagedda, where you will have to fight through swamps, caverns, and the belly of the evil Wurm. In all of these areas, you will face snowmen, hog soldiers, robots, and variety of other enemies. Luckily, you have a large array of punches and kicks at your disposal to dispatch the enemies. Furthermore, some of the items that are lying around can be used to smack some sense into evil. Will Zitz be able to survive the hazards of Armagedda? The only way you'll find out is to play Battletoads.\n\nThe Battletoads game consists of three moves: a punch, a kick and a head-butt. Items include a rod that can be used to hit people and a robot head for throwing. Also, the whole game isn't just the standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwalk left and right and punch peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ style. Most of the levels are like that, but 4 of them consist of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvehiclesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (is a surfboard a vehicle?) that you ride around dodging obstacles or escaping enemies. 3 of the levels have you climb up or down a narrow shaft. There are also a couple one-of-a-kind stages.\n\nBattletoads features:\n---------------------\n*Features multiple levels\n*variety of environments like swamps and caverns\n*large number of enemies\n*special martial arts attacks\n*use random items as weapons\n\nBattletoads Vs. Double Dragon\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEarth is under fire by Colossus, a battleship the size of a city. Using powerful laser cannons, it has destroyed most of Earth's defence forces, while its many troops clean up the rest of the planet. All expect for 5 warriors.\n\nThe Battletoads, who are well aware of evil forces in the galaxy, join forces with Billy and Jimmy Lee from Double Dragon to defend Earth from the deadly ship and its troops. Using a range of special moves you must fight your way through the streets into the heart of the ship and destroy it.\n\nFive playable characters are now available ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Zitz, Rash and Pimple from Battletoads, and Jimmy and Billy from Double Dragon. Each fighter has their own style, yet the gameplay remains consistent no matter whom you choose. The action is definitely more Battletoads than Double Dragon, but Rare does a fine job at connecting the two universes without making it seem forced or arbitrary.\n\n\nBattletoads Vs Battlemaniacs\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBattletoads in Battlemaniacs is a game released by Tradewest in 1993 for the Super NES. It is a sequel to Battletoads.\n\nStory\n-----\nThe story opens with the 'Toads visiting the Gyachung-La fortress in northern Tibet, where the Psicone Corporation is demoing their new virtual reality game system, TRIPS. Suddenly, a pig lackey working for the evil Dark Queen and her partner Silas Volkmire, leaps out of the system and kidnaps Michiko Tashoku (daughter of Psicone Corporation's CEO, Yuriko Tashoku) and Zitz. Now the remaining Battletoads must make chase into the Gamescape, rescue the two captives, and stop Volkmire and the Dark Queen from fulfilling their plans to control the world.\n\nGameplay\n--------\nIn this game of up to two players, you control Pimple or Rash. Both Battletoads have combos and moves to help them defeat their enemies. The artistic style is decidedly cartoony, with exaggerated weapons protruding from the 'Toads' limbs to deliver the coup de grÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ce. Like the original version of Battletoads, this game is also known for its extreme difficulty.\n\n\n[Installation] Doubleclick the Setup files to begin.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
