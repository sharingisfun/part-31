It is hosted by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and produced by Daniel Kay.\n\nA former-pro-soccer-player-turned-Michelin-starred-chef, Gordon Ramsay is looking for someone with the potential to become America's next culinary star. The heat is on and the &quot;steaks&quot; are high as the contestants endure Ramsay's hellishly intense culinary boot camp. Each week Ramsay will grill the ambitious hopefuls as they attempt to prove they have what it takes to run their own restaurant. He will slice and dice the contestants, keeping only those who possess the right combination of ingredients to ensure success. The contestants' inexperience, combined with the perfectionist Ramsay's acid tongue, may be a recipe for disaster, but for one aspiring restaurateur, it's the chance of a lifetime. In this pressure-cooker environment, only one thing is certain: If the contestants can't stand the heat, they'll have to get out of &quot;Hell's Kitchen.&quot;\nGeneral\nComplete name : Hell's Kitchen S09 Complete {XviD} ~Wolftatt2~Hells Kitchen S09\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 349 MiB\nDuration : 42mn 57s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 137 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf53.2.0\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 2\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 42mn 57s\nBit rate : 1 000 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.152\nStream size : 307 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 63\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 42mn 57s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 123 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 37.8 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n\nPlease Seed!\nThank You!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4922472caa47015a1983b34ffe8a881e5db93271","amp;dn":"Hell%5C%27s+Kitchen+S09+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4922472caa47015a1983b34ffe8a881e5db93271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,34,71,44,170,71,1,90,25,131,179,79,254,138,136,30,93,185,50,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
