Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a cube-dwelling hypochondriac whose uneventful life has become a mundane blur of terminal boredom. Repeatedly humiliated by his boss and constantly cuckolded by his cheating girlfriend, weakling Wes seems to be living right down to everyone's expectations that he would never amount to anything in life. However, upon discovering that the father he never knew has been brutally murdered, the spineless, clock-punching pushover is recruited into a secret society of assassins known as the Fraternity. During the course of his training, the man who was once an office-bound wimp develops lightning-fast reflexes and superhuman dexterity courtesy of his skilled mentor Fox (Angelina Jolie). Upon completing his training, Wes is assigned the task of dealing out death to the mythological Fates, who possess the ability to alter the lifelines of mortal men. It isn't long before the nebbish nerd-turned-agile assassin is erasing the bad guys with surprising efficiency, yet as Wes begins to carry the mantle passed down to him by his father, he gradually begins to suspect that his wise tutors are not the crime-fighting enforcers they present themselves to be. Now, with everything he ever wanted in life finally within his grasp, Wes is about to find out that the only thing more difficult than ending the lives of others is summoning the courage to take control of his own.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 40 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcff5f62720b76dba33b47d0736993ad4b4f804","amp;dn":"Wanted%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcff5f62720b76dba33b47d0736993ad4b4f804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,207,245,246,39,32,183,109,186,51,180,125,7,54,153,58,212,180,248,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
