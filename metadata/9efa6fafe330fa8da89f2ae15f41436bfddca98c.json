Each player brings his particular voice to the\nperformances and Yamamoto composed to each of her collaborator's strengths, so\nthe disc feels a bit like a sampler, a distillation of four different\nalbums. From Carter, she coaxes his most lyrical playing, his alto impossibly\nwistful and dreamy on &quot;Conversations.&quot; Drake plays frame drum on both of his\nselections and &quot;Midtown Blues&quot; features Yamamoto's jaunty, brawny physicality\nand strong left hand making up for the lack of an anchoring double bass. That\nanchor returns courtesy of William Parker and &quot;Muse&quot; radiates with warmth,\nregret, beauty and hope, while the opening &quot;Thank You,&quot; with Ughi at the kit,\nis dramatically propulsive.\n\nDuologue is characterized by lovely songcraft and guileless performances and is\na perfect showcase for Yamamoto's dense, impressionistic cascades and dazzling\nromantic swoon. The inside cover photo of the five musicians, lined up arm in\narm, proves they were all together at one time in one spot. What a quintet that\nwould be.\n\n\n--\n\n\nby Lyn Horton &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=29805&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=29805&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Steve Greenlee &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/19950-duologue-eri-yamamoto&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/19950-duologue-eri-yamamoto&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor JosÃƒÂ© Francisco Ã¢â‚¬Å“PachiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=3142&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=3142&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efa6fafe330fa8da89f2ae15f41436bfddca98c","amp;dn":"Eri+Yamamoto+-+Duologue+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efa6fafe330fa8da89f2ae15f41436bfddca98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,250,111,175,227,48,250,141,168,159,42,225,95,65,67,107,253,220,169,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
