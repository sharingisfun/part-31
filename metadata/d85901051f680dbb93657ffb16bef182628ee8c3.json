Amazingly, for a group who have just turned 20, this will be SugababesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fourth studio album. Sugababes have collaborated, for the first time on the new record, with some of the best producers and writers in the business; Dallas Austin (TLC, Madonna, Pink), Guy Sigsworth (Madonna, Britney Spears), and Cathy Dennis (Kylie). Mutya, Keisha and Heidi have also continued their long-standing working relationship with Brian Higgins, Cameron McVeigh (All Saints) and Johnny Rockstar (Robbie Williams) to produce their most accomplished album to date. \n\n\n\n\n\ns3r4hb3th = &quot;sarahbeth&quot; a name you can trust.\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n&quot;added web seed for faster downloads&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d85901051f680dbb93657ffb16bef182628ee8c3","amp;dn":"Sugababes+Taller+in+More+Ways++256kbps+s3r4hb3th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d85901051f680dbb93657ffb16bef182628ee8c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,89,1,5,31,104,13,187,147,101,127,251,22,190,241,130,98,142,232,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
