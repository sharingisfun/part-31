In 1983, Schilling released &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home),&quot; a synth pop retelling of Bowie's 1969 classic &quot;Space Oddity.&quot; It became Schilling's first and only entry in the U.S. charts, a song that eventually stigmatized him as a one-hit wonder in America. Schilling was born in Stuttgart, Germany, on January 28, 1956. As a teen, Schilling couldn't decide on whether to be a soccer player or a singer. He chose music and his debut album, Error in the System, appeared in 1983. The single &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot; wasn't just popular in the U.S., it was a worldwide smash. The video was played often on MTV, as well, but Schilling was not able to equal its success. In 1989, Schilling collaborated with Enigma's Michael CrÃƒÂ©tu on the track &quot;Different Story (World of Lust and Crime),&quot; an admirable attempt at updating his sound and trying to return to the American charts. &quot;Major Tom&quot; was given a techno sheen in 1994, and the reworked song was welcomed in the clubs. A year later, Schilling formed the Space Pilots with Catyana Schilling, J. Feifel, and P. Magnet, recording Trip to Orion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8657aec8bbb27749adab4c4307982b634196dd","amp;dn":"Peter+Schilling+-+Discography+1982+-+2010+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8657aec8bbb27749adab4c4307982b634196dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,134,87,174,200,187,178,119,73,173,171,76,67,7,152,43,99,65,150,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
