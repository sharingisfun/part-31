Sugriva then \nsends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success \nfrom north, east and west.\n\nThe southern search party under the leadership of Angad and Hanuman learns \nfrom a vulture named Sampati that Sita was taken to Lanka.\n\n\n\nI WILL POST ALL THE KANDAS ONE BY ONE...\n\nPLZ SEED THIS DIVINE TORRENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..\n\nYOU WILL BE ONE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF RAMAYANA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD...\n\nTHIS TORRENT IS NOT RESTRICTED TO HINDUS ONLY...\n\nANY ONE CAN SPREAD GOOD MESSAGE IF THEY HAVE NICE, PEACEFUL HEART..\n\nPLZ SEED GUYZ...\n\nTHANK YOU..\n\n\nPLZ SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE..I AM LACKING SEEDS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21adec3a60f022f09efebf91fe284518cf1edf88","amp;dn":"Shrimad+Valmiki+Ramayana+-Kishkindha+Kanda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21adec3a60f022f09efebf91fe284518cf1edf88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,173,236,58,96,240,34,240,158,254,191,145,254,40,69,24,207,30,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
