Her lyrics are smart, engaging, and often times touching.  Along with that, you have assistance from the likes of Ricard Thompson, Jim Keltner, Tony Levin, and the excellent production of Mitchell Froom, who has made so many great albums with Thompson.  This album is can't miss, so don't.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplese seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/09/16/maria-mckeeyou-gotta-sin-to-get-saved/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/09/16/maria-mckeeyou-gotta-sin-to-get-saved/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed47f49f03963dcff70bc36bf3c330dabfe9b16","amp;dn":"Maria+McKee...Maria+McKee%281989%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed47f49f03963dcff70bc36bf3c330dabfe9b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,212,127,73,240,57,99,220,255,112,188,54,191,60,51,13,171,254,155,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
