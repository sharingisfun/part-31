Put a &amp;#039;The&amp;#039; in front of them and you have a band. Of sorts.\n\nThe Hope Blister began in the fertile mind of Ivo Watts-Russell, who founded 4AD in 1980 and embarked on one of the most enterprising journeys known to independent record labels, travelling from The Birthday Party to Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance to The Pixies. In the midst of all this activity, Ivo found time to conceive This Mortal Coil: a collective of musicians he&amp;#039;d either signed, knew or admired, playing a heavenly jukebox of his favourite songs. Ivo wasn&amp;#039;t a musician himself, but he had this sound in his head; with help from engineer John Fryer, he &amp;#039;conducted&amp;#039; the players, wrote instrumental links, and came up with three acclaimed albums: It&amp;#039;ll End In Tears (1984), Filigree And Shadow (1986) and Blood (1990).\n\nThe Hope Blister&amp;#039;s 1998 debut, ...Smiles OK, comprised eight songs penned by a variety of artists, including Brian Eno (&quot;Spider And I&quot;), John Cale (&quot;Hanky Panky Nohow&quot;), David Sylvian (&quot;Let The Happiness In&quot;), Heidi Berry (&quot;Only Human&quot;) and Mojave 3&amp;#039;s Neil Halstead (&quot;Dagger&quot;). The mail-order album Underarms followed a year later, featuring largely instrumental outtakes from the same sessions.\n\nAlbum\n\n1. Underarms &amp; Sideaways (2 cd&amp;#039;s), 2005 (4AD)\n2.
