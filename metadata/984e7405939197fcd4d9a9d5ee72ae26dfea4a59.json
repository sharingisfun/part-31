Howard and Harold Lamb. Though Oden started writing his own tales at the age of fourteen, it would be many years before anything would come of it. \n\nIn the meantime, he had a brief and tempestuous fling with academia before retiring to the private sector, where he worked the usual roster of odd jobsÃ¢â‚¬â€from delivering pizza to stacking paper in the bindery of a printing company to clerking at a video store. Nowadays, Oden writes full-time from his family home near Somerville.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical\n\n\nMen of Bronze:\n\nIt is 526 B.C. and the empire of the Pharaohs is dying, crushed by the weight of its own antiquity. Decay riddles its cities, infects its aristocracy, and weakens its armies. While across the expanse of Sinai, like jackals drawn to carrion, the forces of the King of Persia watch and wait. Leading the fight to preserve the soul of Egypt is Hasdrabal Barca, PharaohÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest killer. Possessed of a rage few men can fathom and fewer can withstand, Barca struggles each day to preserve the last sliver of his humanity. \n\nBut, when one of EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated generals, a Greek mercenary called Phanes, defects to the Persians, it triggers a savage war that will tax BarcaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills, and his humanity, to the limit. From the political wasteland of Palestine, to the searing deserts east of the Nile, to the streets of ancient Memphis, Barca and Phanes play a desperate game of cat-and-mouse Ã¢â‚¬â€ a game culminating in the bloodiest battle of EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. Caught in the midst of this violence is Jauharah, a slave in the House of Life. \n\nShe is Arabian, dark-haired and proud Ã¢â‚¬â€ a healer with gifts her blood, her station, and her gender overshadow. Though her hands tend to BarcaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s countless wounds, it is her spirit that heals and changes him. Once a fearsome demigod of war, Hasdrabal Barca becomes human again. A man now motivated as much by love as anger. Nevertheless honor and duty have bound Barca to the fate of Egypt. A final conflict remains, a reckoning set to unfold in the dusty hills east of Pelusium. There, over the dead of two nations, Hasdrabal Barca will face the same choice as the heroes of old: Death and eternal fame or obscurity and long life.\n\nMemnon:\n\nHe lived in the shadow of kings. One trusted him with his empire; the other feared his every move...Memnon of Rhodes (375-333 BCE) walked in the footsteps of giants. As a soldier, sailor, statesman, and general, he was, in the words of Diodorus of Sicily, &quot;outstanding in courage and strategic grasp.&quot; A contemporary of Demosthenes and Aristotle, Memnon rose from humble origins to command the whole of western Asia in a time of strife and slaughter. \n\nTo his own people, he was a traitor, to his rivals, a mercenary. But, to the King of Kings, his majesty Darius III of Persia, Memnon was one man capable of defending Asia Minor from the rising power of the barbaric Macedonians. In a war pitting Greek against Greek, Memnon proved his quality beyond measure. His enemies fought for glory and gold; Memnon fought for something more, for loyalty, for honor, and for duty. He fought for the love of Barsine, a woman of remarkable beauty and grace. Most of all, he fought for the promise of peace. \n\nThrough the deathbed recollections of a mysterious woman, the life of Memnon unfolds with brilliant clarity. It is a record of his triumphs and tragedies, his loves and lossess, and of the determination that drove him to stand against the most renowned figure of the ancient world-the ambitious young conqueror called Alexander the Great.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984e7405939197fcd4d9a9d5ee72ae26dfea4a59","amp;dn":"Two+Novels+by+Scott+Oden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984e7405939197fcd4d9a9d5ee72ae26dfea4a59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,78,116,5,147,145,151,252,212,217,169,213,238,114,174,38,223,234,74,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
